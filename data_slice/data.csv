"1","The Man on the Spot Over Rail Safety",5230,"|u.s.",20,1,1987,"19870120T000000","|BALTIMORE (MD)|MARYLAND"," 
 When Congress adjourned last fall, John H. Riley, head of the Federal Railroad Administration, started polishing up his resume and began looking forward to leaving Government early this year. 
 In three and a half years at the helm of the agency, Mr. Riley had negotiated the sale of two small railroad properties owned by the Government and had carried the flag for the Reagan Administration in its bitter battle with Congress over the sale of Conrail, the giant Philadelphia-based freight carrier. 
 Last year he helped block Congressional adoption of legislation that would have restored some regulation of rates and expanded layoff benefits for some rail workers. Before that, he helped draft a long-awaited Federal rule aimed at curbing alcohol and drug abuse in the rail industry. 
 So, with the widely heralded sale of the Government's stock in Conrail anticipated for this spring, the stage appeared set for Mr. Riley's smooth departure. 
 But then came the collision north of Baltimore Jan. 4 between an Amtrak passenger train and a unit of engines owned by Conrail. 
 Sixteen people among the hundreds of passengers were killed, and more than 170 were injured. And questions were raised about the safety of the rail system that Mr. Riley had been overseeing. Departure Is Delayed 
 As a result, Mr. Riley's departure is now delayed indefinitely, and it is likely to be far from smooth. Long-time critics of his safety enforcement efforts have seized upon the accident to spotlight what they consider the railroad agency's weak stand on safety. 
 ''In the normal routine of safety, Riley hasn't done a darn thing,'' said Lawrence M. Mann, a Washington lawyer who represents rail labor unions on safety issues before Congress and the agency, and who participated in the drafting of the Railroad Safety Act of 1970. 
 ''He doesn't act in a preventive way, but after the fact,'' Mr. Mann said. 
 Mr. Riley, a tall, thin, talkative man who turned 40 years old today, voices little fear of his critics. He says safety has been a priority and has not been neglected in his tenure. 
 ''I've been able to put together the three safest years in industry history,'' said the Bronx-born administrator, who came to the railroad agency from Capitol Hill after working as chief counsel to Senator Dave Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota. 
 ''I've been uncompromising on safety and will continue to be uncompromising,'' Mr. Riley said. ''The problem with making safety a priority is that the public glare never goes over the whole context, but on the last accident.'' 
 He contends that the recent collision was an exception to the trend in railroad safety. Statistics seem to support his argument, showing a surge in rail accidents in 1984, followed by a steady drop in 1985 and 1986. 
 Despite his defense, Mr. Riley is anticipating a ''bushel basket'' of proposals for improving safety in the Northeast Corridor between Washington and Boston. ''Within a few weeks, we'll have a tidal wave of ideas from everyone,'' he said. ''It will be our job to sort them out and determine what's feasible. We'll recommend the ideas that we think will make a difference in the end.'' 
 Immediately after the Amtrak-Conrail crash, he visited the site. Since then he has suggested reconsideration of several safety ideas discarded by prior rail chiefs, such as separating freight and passenger traffic in the Northeast Corridor. 
 Among the complaints likely to gain attention as Mr. Riley faces Congressional panels looking into the accident are those involving the lack of rules to assure worker and passenger safety and the Administration's attempts in recent years to eliminate Federal funds for railroad safety inspectors as part of Government cost cutting. 
 The effectiveness of the new alcohol and drug abuse rule has also been called into question, in light of findings of traces of marijuana in the urine and blood of the Conrail crew involved in the accident and findings that three of six crew members involved in a December train wreck in Philadelphia had tested positive for cocaine. 
 Lawmakers and other critics are also expected to question the effectiveness of a 1981 policy change regarding safety enforcement that has been embraced by Mr. Riley. As a result of that change, the railroad agency stopped imposing fines for safety violations and began stressing working with carriers on a ''cooperative'' basis to encourage compliance. 'Some Unjustifiable Things' 
 Representative James J. Florio, a New Jersey Democrat who has sponsored several pieces of rail safety legislation, agrees that something must be done. 
 But unlike many critics, he does not fault Mr. Riley entirely. Rather, he says Mr. Riley's bosses, including Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole and President Reagan, must share much of the blame because, he says, they are the ultimate formulators of Administration rail safety policy. 
 Mr. Florio said of Mr. Riley: ''He's someone who knows the subject matter and who, left to his own devices, would probably advocate policies different from those being pushed by the Administration. He's called upon to justify some unjustifiable things.''  WASHINGTON TALK: FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION"

 Despite the arrival of some relief supplies in a besieged Palestinian refugee district here today, conditions in the district were described as desperate, with thousands of people suffering from malnutrition. 
 Four pickup trucks carrying food rolled into the refugee compound, Burj al Brajneh, on the southern outskirts of Beirut, during the early hours of the morning. It was not known when the next convoy of relief aid would be allowed in. 
 An earlier attempt to get the trucks into the district was thwarted by gunmen who fired at the convoy Friday, killing an Iranian Embassy official and wounding a colleague. The incident touched off a renewal of artillery exchanges between militiamen of the Shiite Moslem movement Amal, which has ringed the camp since October, and Palestinian guerrillas defending Burj al Brajneh, where about 30,000 people live. 
 The supplies that reached the camp included flour and dried milk. After the shooting Friday evening, the food was transferred from United Nations trucks to vehicles belonging to the Iranian Embassy, which has been supervising relief efforts, and was taken into the camp early this morning. An Appeal for More Aid Soon 
 Dr. Pauline Cutting, a British surgeon working inside Burj al Brajneh, told reporters by telephone that Iranian Embassy vehicles brought in a small quantity of supplies and took out four wounded people. 
 She said that only a small amount of flour reached the camp during the night, and that just about everyone in the camp was malnourished. She said she believed that unless more food reached Burj al Brajneh very soon, people would be starving to death within a week. 
 Dr. Cutting said the people at Burj al Brajneh were aware of efforts to bring relief supplies to them. When reports circulated Friday that a convoy was on the way, people came out in the streets in a state of expectation. But the camp was then shelled, she said, and 6 people died and 24 were wounded. 
 Amal, which is headed by Lebanon's Justice Minister, Nabih Berri, says the siege around Palestinian centers in Beirut and southern Lebanon will not be lifted until guerrillas who follow the Palestine Liberation Organization leader, Yasir Arafat, evacuate positions captured from the Shiite militia last November in southern Lebanon."

 Earvin (Magic) Johnson scored 39 points and led Los Angeles back from a 17-point third-quarter deficit to a 106-103 victory over the Boston Celtics, giving the Lakers the best record in the National Basketball Association. 
 Johnson scored 8 points over the final three and a half minutes, including two clinching free throws with four seconds to play, to lift the Lakers to their 38th victory in 50 games this season, one game better than the Celtics. 
 After the teams exchanged baskets, Johnson sank an 18-footer with 23 seconds to play to put the Lakers ahead, 102-99. 
 After Robert Parish scored on a dunk, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar made two free throws to put the Lakers up by 104-101 with 16 seconds to play. The free throws gave Abdul-Jabbar 10 points, keeping alive his streak of 743 consecutive games in double figures. CROWD MARK 
 PONTIAC, Mich., Feb. 15 (AP) -Buyers of $2 tickets furnished by an oil company accounted for nearly half of the record crowd for a regular-season National Basketball Association game, a Detroit Pistons spokesman said today. 
 Attendance for Saturday night's game at the Pontiac Silverdome, in which the Pistons defeated Philadelphia, 125-107, was 52,745, club spokesman Matt Dobek said. 
 The N.B.A.'s previous regular-season record was 44,180, set a year ago at a Silverdome game in which Detroit defeated Philadelphia, 134-133, in overtime. 
 Attendance at both of those games, including an estimated 25,000 tickets sold for Saturday's contest, was swollen by $2 tickets sold at Marathon Oil Company service stations, Dobek said.

"4","Moore Sculpture Approved to Be Altar",14629,"|arts",19,2,1987,"19870219T000000","|LONDON (ENG)"," 
 An ecclesiastical court has ruled that a marble block sculptured by Henry Moore is a suitable church altar. 
 The Court of Ecclesiastical Causes Reserved of the Church of England said the modern sculpture could remain in use as the altar in the 17th-century St. Stephen Walbrook Church, a Sir Christopher Wren masterpiece in central London. 
 The ruling overturns a February 1986 decision by the chancellor of the London Diocesan Consistory Court, George Newsom. He said the eight-and-a-half-ton, flat-topped sculpture, which has no legs and sits on a circular base, could not be considered a holy table and should be removed from the church. 
 Under Anglican law, an altar must function as a table, in remembrance of Christ's Last Supper. 
 A property developer, Peter Palumbo, who is spending $2 million to renovate the church, and church officials appealed Chancellor Newsom's decision. The ecclesiastical court, consisting of two High Court judges, two bishops and a former bishop, ruled in their favor. 
 Mr. Palumbo, a patron of modern art, commissioned the sculpture in 1967. Moore, one of Britain's greatest sculptors, died last August at age 88."

 The Condit House has a lot going for it. The three-story, Federal-style structure in West Orange, N.J., thought to be built in 1821, has four marble fireplaces, hand-carved woodwork, a fieldstone foundation and wavy window panes. ''But it has been bastardized,'' said Richard Polton, a developer specializing in historic restoration, referring to the white vinyl siding that now sheathes the original scallop-edged clapboards. 
 Mr. Polton, president of Touchstone Properties in Montclair, N.J., has a contract to buy the house, at 7 Main Street, for $350,000 from St. Mark's Episcopal Church next door, which has owned it since 1885. Upon taking title, Mr. Polton plans to restore and convert the 14-room property into 7,000 square feet of professional office space, to be leased for $12 a foot. 
 Touchstone Properties, together with Brawer & Hauptman Architects of Philadelphia, will restore the exterior to its original state, peeling off the vinyl and determining historic color schemes. The interior, whose first floor was recently refurbished by a local preservationist, Louise Dixon Schickhaus, will be done as well. The house was put on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977."

"7","THEATER: 'ON THE VERGE,' AT THE JOHN HOUSEMAN",18436,"|arts|theater",3,3,1987,"19870303T000000",NA," 
 AFTER an overland trek through America's regional theaters, Eric Overmyer's ''On the Verge or the Geography of Yearning'' has arrived in New York with its wit and imagination intact. The play opened last night at the John Houseman Theater in a production ingeniously outfitted by the director Garland Wright, and by members of the Acting Company. 
 During the play's visits to various other ports of call - I saw two different prior productions, at Center Stage in Baltimore and at the Hartford Stage Company - the author used his machete to thwack away at the thicket of puns and imagery. As a result, the play has become pithier, but more pruning would have been advisable; each of the two acts remains attenuated. 
 However, the surfeit does not deter us from appreciating the journey, as Mr. Overmyer sends three prototypical Victorian women explorers touring through time, space and metaphor. In common with S. J. Perelman and Tom Stoppard, the author has a connoisseur's love of language. In addition, he is enamored of his explorers, heroines who leave the comfort of cities like Terre Haute in order to sojourn to a Terra that becomes increasingly Incognita. 
 The show begins neatly enough as the three (Lisa Banes, Patricia Hodges and Laura Hicks) gird themselves for their expedition. They are equipped for all Arctic-tropic emergencies. Even as they are buffeted by surprises, they remain surefooted and quick-minded. These are, stalwartly, pre-feminist representatives of the stronger sex. 
 They tell us tall tales of past exploits - teaching headhunters to play croquet, watching the Dalai Lama transform gold coins into yak butter. To a great extent, the palaver is the action, although periodically the women wander astray and meet strangers, all species played by Tom Robbins. Gradually, one realizes that there is something sub-terra afoot, a dislocation with the dimension of a time warp. 
 The explorers receive psychic messages from the future. Strange words like ''Cool Whip'' enter their perception and unknown artifacts are discovered on the landscape. Confronted with an egg beater, they regard it quizzically and then conclude it must be a talisman. Merrily, the playwright forges ahead from fanciful reinterpretation of history to contemporary cultural commentary. 
 Like Mark Twain's Eve, the explorers see the world - and say the words - as if for the first time. Questioning such self-made contradictions as ''guest hosts,'' they begin to dabble in semiotics. At least in part, the play is about the debasement of language. As one of the women says, ''I have seen the future and it is slang.'' 
 Eventually the time travelers reach the 1950's. A palanquin pulls up at an Esso station and a Dragon Lady emerges, soon followed by other odd figures. Faced with the apotheosis of 1955, only one of the three heroines continues the chronokinetic excursion, marching onward to the future, which is, of course, our present. 
 Because of the vertiginous verbiage, the play is an Everest for actresses. Memorization itself is a tongue-tripping feat. The Acting Company trio performs with the agility of a team of high-wire walkers while also demonstrating an evident zest for the material. 
 During the play's two-year passage to New York, the author has sharpened the individuality of his characters. Ms. Banes is playing the most insurgent of the three - a born pioneer. Ms. Hodges, the most traditional, has a fondness for hearth and husband (he appears in a dream sequence). Ms. Hicks, a photojournalist in the making, is a montage of modernism. While the actresses seek singular definition, Mr. Robbins is a self-diffuser. Chameleon-like, he shifts from cannibal to Actors Studio-trained troll to an Adorable Snowman. 
 More than his directorial predecessors in Baltimore and Hartford, Mr. Wright has successfully moved the script away from literalization. This is the most intimate and also the most eye-catching of the three productions, and it is augmented by John Arnone's clean geometric set design. Mr. Arnone uses neon-like bars of light to denote everything from rope bridges to jungles, converting the stage into a Mondrian-like environment of perpendiculars. James F. Ingalls's lighting adds its own signal pleasure, with a shift of tone simulating both glacier and desert, and Ann Hould-Ward's costumes are like the best of Banana Republic. The staging and the performances reduce the play's whimsy quotient. 
 ''On the Verge'' is, by intention, a highly speculative and specialized venture, but for the linguistically inclined, this ardently alliterative and omnivorously onomatopoetic safari should be difficult to resist."
"8","ARGUING THE CASE FOR HAIR",21280,"|health|style",14,3,1987,"19870314T000000",NA," 
 On Monday the Upjohn Company is to give the Food and Drug Administration the results of its tests on Rogaine, a product the company wants to sell as a baldness remedy. But the application for approval by the F.D.A. has prompted sharp criticism from the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a consumer organization that has accused Upjohn of trying to ''make bald people feel insecure.'' 
 Upjohn has defended its activities concerning Rogaine, which originally was developed as minoxidil, a drug to treat high blood pressure. 
 Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, head of the Health Research Group, said Upjohn had been preparing the way for the sale of Rogaine to the public by issuing press releases under the letterhead of an organization it formed, Hair Awareness Information and Research, or HAIR. 
 Dr. Wolfe read from one release, titled ''Psychological Aspects of Hair Loss,'' which said, ''Can an emerging bald spot, or even a noticeably receding hairline, damage your ability to get along with others, influence your chances of obtaining a job or even interfere with your job performance?'' 
 The release quoted H.Hugh Floyd Jr., a professor of sociology at the University of New Orleans, as saying, ''Losing one's hair can have tremendous psychological influence and definitely affects self-confidence and self-assurance.'' 
 Dr. Wolfe asserted that Upjohn was engaging in a ''sleazy, shameless prepromotional campaign to make bald people feel as bad as possible'' and to encourage them to use Rogaine, a liquid applied to the scalp, if it is approved for sale. 
 A spokeswoman for Upjohn, Jan R. AufderHeide, said there was nothing negative about the campaign. ''It was informational, not promotional,'' she said. ''This is a common practice to inform and educate the public.'' 
 Rogaine has generated more consumer interest, as measured by letters and telephone calls, than any other product in the 101-year history of Upjohn, she added. 
 Rogaine is safe and effective, Miss AufderHeide said. In a yearlong test of 1,833 bald men, she said, 40 percent reported moderate hair growth after using the product. Doctors examining the men reported that among 76 percent of them, one or more new hairs had grown in a one-inch circle at the crown of the head, Miss AufderHeide said. 
 The findings also will state, she said, that there was no significant difference in the blood pressure, pulse rate or weight of men using Rogaine and those who used a placebo. 
 It is not known how long it will take the Government to act on Upjohn's application. Just What's Beer?  What is beer? A Federal statute does not address what its alcohol content should be, and two Federal agencies have differed on whether a beverage without alcohol can rightly be called beer. 
 The Federal Trade Commission has recommended that the makers of malt beverages be permitted to call their products beer, ale, lager, stout or porter, even if all or most of the alcohol has been removed. But the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has proposed that the use of the word beer and related terms continue to be forbidden for beverages that have less than 0.5 percent alcohol. 
 ''The only purpose of this restriction,'' the F.T.C. asserted in its recommendation, ''appears to be to protect consumers from purchasing this product . . . on the mistaken belief that they are buying an alcoholic beverage.'' Rather than protecting drinkers of alcoholic beverages, the agency said, the restrictions ''are likely to harm consumers who are seeking healthier and safer substitutes by depriving them of valuable information concerning the alternative of nonalcoholic beer.'' 
 Under the bureau's proposed regulation, beerlike nonalcoholic drinks would have to be called malt beverages, cereal beverages or near beer. 
 The brewers of nonalcoholic beer, the F.T.C. staff said, are unlikely to try to sell their product as containing alcohol because such beverages are geared to consumers who want to reduce their consumption of alcohol. Their marketing, the staff said, emphasizes the absence of alcohol. 
 The importers of Moussy, which is brewed in Switzerland, are opposing the bureau's proposal, which would continue to require that Moussy, which has virtually no alcohol, be labeled a malt beverage. 
 ''We would like to call it nonalcoholic beer,'' said Myles J. Ambrose, a lawyer representing the importer. 
 Supporting the bureau is the Beer Institute, which represents breweries whose beverages have the normal alcohol content of 3 to 4 percent and those who make the newer low-alcohol beers with less than 2.5 percent. The institute wants those beverages to be the only ones entitled to be called beer; to do otherwise would confuse consumers, it said.

 The Islanders' playoff prospects are slightly brighter because of the return of Denis Potvin, the veteran defenseman who missed 17 games with a sprained left knee. Potvin, who needs 3 points to become the first defenseman to reach 1,000 career points, traveled with the team to St. Louis and will probably start against the Blues tonight. New York, with four games left, is trying to secure second place in the Patrick Division and gain the home-ice edge in the first round of the playoffs. 
 Gord Dineen and Greg Gilbert, who both had shoulder separations, also rejoined the team, and two rookies, Neal Coulter and Randy Wood, were returned to Springfield. Tomas Jonsson, who sustained multiple fractures of the jaw in a Jan. 22 automobile accident, may play in Thursday's game against the Nordiques.

"11","Creature Comforts",29213,"|magazine",12,4,1987,"19870412T000000",NA," 
 My litany of household luxuries is simpler than most - I don't really want to live with taffeta curtains that puddle on the floor, with walls tinted by layers of hand-rubbed lacquer or even with a roomful of 18th-century museum-quality antiques. Luxuries like these are too costly and too obvious for my tastes. I prefer smaller and more subtle symbols: never running out of ice, not having to fumble for a bedside light switch, a television remote control that lets me effortlessly silence unbearable commercials. I am, however, fond of comfort, and although I don't like to admit it, some simple luxuries that I cherish - and that few others even notice -have probably cost me as much as a bird's-eye maple highboy. 
 Take the case of the ice-maker in my country barn, which has become a center of activity on August afternoons. Guests never comment on its form or beauty as they fill their glasses, but I am unable to pick up a cube without remembering that installing this modern device in my century-old kitchen cost $1,200 more than the estimate. Getting it hitched up forced a review of the inefficient wiring, resulting in the entire place being rewired. Even the plumbing costs skyrocketed. On quiet nights, when I hear the mysterious clunking of water being turned into icy slices, I recall the bill for the expensive copper tubing that was snaked through the joists of the ripped-up floor by an equally expensive plumber. 
 That experience taught me that simple comforts do not come simply. It's also a classic example of the Mushroom Effect: However small a renovation project seems at the beginning, it will inevitably grow larger, costing more money or taking more time than anticipated. And sometimes both. In the case of the ice-maker, I was lucky - those joists might have been rotten and the floor could have collapsed. 
 Another premise often applies to renovation projects: If you make mistakes, learn to live with them gracefully. I doubt if I'll ever be happy about the world-class mildew growing in the cupboard over the downstairs shower, but it's my fault for being greedy. Storage space, I've always felt, is the ultimate luxury, and that vacant spot above the shower had irritated me for years. Remodeling the bathroom gave me the perfect opportunity to make the space useful, although this, too, shot my budget over the moon. ''Custom cabinetry and extra tiling weren't included in the original estimate,'' the contractor frostily reminded me. But the real tragedy was that I never gave a thought to the consequences of constant dampness: Nothing can be stored in that cupboard except mildew. Guests - who so jauntily ignore the ice-maker's expensive charms - are universally fascinated. They bring nostrums and make creative suggestions for adaptive re-use. The best idea so far has been the notion of taking off the doors and making the cupboard into an overhead fernery, but I sense that the only graceful way to cope with mildew is to live and let live. 
 I should point out, however, that some of my ideas of quiet luxuries have indeed been successes - and inexpensive ones at that. After all, my remote control came free with my new television set. And on one rainy afternoon I made a trip to the dime store and installed hand switches on the cords of every lamp in the house. The lamp fix was so satisfying that I went for the linen closet, a jumble of mismatched sheets. Pulling out every sheet, I tried them on the four sizes of beds that inhabit my bedrooms and marked them clearly with the bed size they fitted. Luxurious order at last. 
 Still, I am often alone in the appreciation of these small comforts and conveniences. Others take them for granted and comment instead on flashier items - like the needlework cushions heaped on my sofa. Old embroidered cushions are a design icon these days, though mine wouldn't survive the scrutiny of any decorator of the English-country-house persuasion. Mostly flea-market bits and pieces, they are definitely of the lower order. Still, they are treasured finds and whether Berlin work, beaded or cross-stitched, those cushions represent a luxury to me: I had every shabby one of them restuffed with down. These days, designers wax lyrical about down. The difference between feathers and polyester may be invisible, they preach, but the derriere and the back know for sure. My guests sink comfortably into that heap of cushions, never aware that each is a triumph of natural over man-made fibers. ''What a fabulous collection of fancy pillows you have,'' they exclaim, stretching back. Secretly, I know, they are praising the wrong luxury - the down stuffing is what really counts. 
 Sometimes - usually while lying in a bubble bath where such thoughts seem to come more clearly - I muse on other quiet comforts I would like to add to my life. Some are affordable, requiring only time and organization. I would like, for example, to replace all the wire clothes hangers in my closets with sturdy padded versions. 
 Other luxuries are a bit more involved but are still possible, such as having every door in the house rehung so the latches fit tightly (starting with the particularly mischievous upstairs bathroom door, which silently swings open on its own with no warning). And while I'm at it, I'd like to replace the hollow-core bedroom doors with solid ones - I'm tired of wiggly clothes hooks. 
 But other luxuries are well beyond my reach, like new living-room curtains. The used-but-still-elegant pair I bought at a house sale 12 years ago for $30 are now in shreds. Replacement fabric, I discovered after much research, is woven to order at 18 inches wide, has a six-month delivery date and costs $100 a yard. 
 I plan to study up on how Miss Haversham handled such tattered situations and work for more affordable comforts. This summer, in fact, I'm going to collar a couple of guests to help me figure out the circuit-breaker box. For more than a decade I have never known which switch controls which room or appliance; the scrawled labels are now hopelessly unreadable. Two hours ought to do it, I figure, and I'll be rid of flickering confusion forever. I'll have to bribe them with ice-laden drinks, but that simple fix will probably be the most satisfying household luxury of all.

"15","U.S. AND SOVIET PLAN STUDY OF OZONE HOLE IN ANTARCTICA'S SKIES",50350,"|u.s.",19,6,1987,"19870619T000000","|UNITED STATES|UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS|ANTARCTICA"," 
 A cooperative effort to study ozone and other gases that could affect the earth's climate is being started by scientists from the United States and Soviet Union. 
 The new agreement, announced today, calls for particular emphasis on the atmosphere over Antarctica, where scientists have detected a hole in the ozone layer, which protects the earth from damaging ultraviolet radiation from the sun. 
 Officials of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the new agreement expanded current programs for the exchange of weather information. The officials said the scientists would study at the atmosphere above Antarctica from both above and below the ozone layer. Ozone ''Profiles'' by U.S.  The United States will collect daily ozone profiles of the continent from its weather satellites orbiting over the South Pole, and Soviet scientists will collect data from the ground. They will use an array of instruments supplied and calibrated by the oceanic administration's national research laboratory at Boulder, Colo. That will allow all the data collected to be comparable, so that scientists from both countries can more easily share the findings. 
 The hole in the ozone over Antarctica appears in the spring of the Southern Hemisphere, September and October, and closes in the Antarctic winter. But scientists report that the hole seems to deepen each year, and they have eppressed fears that this reflects ozone depletion over much of the globe. 
 Many scientists consider chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons, released into the atmosphere from refrigerants and other uses, to be a likely cause of ozone depletion. When those chemicals are broken down by sunlight they release chlorine, which reacts with the ozone. The United States banned use of the chemicals in aerosol sprays in 1978, but they still have other uses and are common in other nations. Some Blame the Wind 
 Some scientists attribute the the ozone depletion to natural nitrogen oxide compounds in the atmosphere, which vary in 11-year cycles. Others blame the wind for moving the ozone-rich air out of the Antarctic area in certain seasons. 
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency reported last fall that depletion of the worldwide ozone layer could cause 800,000 additional deaths by skin cancer by the year 2074 by removing the current protection from sunlight. 
 The pact between the superpowers could also lead to investigations of desert dust in the atmosphere, an Arctic gas and aerosol sampling program and a chemical and radiation experiment in the Arctic."
"16","HOW CONTRAS RECRUIT: THE KIDNAPPING WAY",51140,"|world|front page|washington",22,6,1987,"19870622T000000","|NICARAGUA"," 
 The rebel unit flagged down the local bus in northern Nicaragua and summarily ordered the male passengers to get out. 
 Then, without further explanation, the guerrillas gave the order: the men would follow the rebels to a contra camp. The women were told to get on their way, according to several witnesses and human-rights officials. 
 The mass kidnapping two months ago near the town of Siuna is one of several reports of forced recruitment of civilians by the American-backed rebels, known as contras, in recent months. It is a politically damaging practice that Reagan Administration and rebel officials have repeatedly pledged to stop. A Tale of Misery 
 Most of the 15 to 20 men taken from the bus escaped in the following nights during a forced march through the jungle. But for Omar Navas, who says he was too slow and too afraid to escape -and also for his family - the kidnapping on April 27 was the beginning of a miserable experience that has not yet ended. 
 Mr. Navas told his story to this reporter in a rebel camp on the Honduran-Nicaraguan border last month. The reporter then traveled to Nicaragua, where he found Mr. Navas's parents, who had believed their son to be dead. They celebrated the news that he had been seen alive, and they spoke of their experience with a conflict that has destroyed their lives. 
 Their story offers a human measure of the unsought war and bitterly contested revolution in Nicaragua that have split communities, killed tens of thousands, and wrecked the lives of countless people like the Navas family. 'I Want to Go Home' 
 ''Can you help me?'' Mr. Navas quietly asked as Sandinista rockets exploded near a contra border camp during a major attack last month. ''I want to go home.'' 
 Mr. Navas, 35 years old, could not walk. His bandaged feet were swollen like grotesque melons to twice their normal size because of a congenital problem with walking and cuts that became infected after a 21-day march with his contra kidnappers in the San Jacinto regional task force. 
 A former schoolteacher, Mr. Navas recently became an accountant in a state-owned lumber yard, a job he took to earn more money for his family. He seemed an unsuitable candidate for guerrilla war: In addition to his inability to walk properly, he is in poor physical shape and has a young family, and he appears to have no strong political views. Parents Hear Their Son Lives 
 ''I am not at all political, and I told them when they took me that I could not walk properly,'' Mr. Navas said, breaking into slow tears. ''I have a wife, I have two young daughters -what will happen to them without me?'' 
 Three weeks later, Mr. Navas's aging parents expressed reactions that were as deeply felt in their impoverished home in a working class neighborhood of Managua. 
 The elder Mr. Navas, 78, had just come home after being hospitalized for an acute nervous disorder brought on, his wife said, by his anxiety at losing Omar, his eldest son and the family's breadwinner. They had heard nothing of him since the rebel patrol took him away. 'He Knows Nothing About War' 
 ''God brought this news to us,'' cried Mrs. Navas, 57, as she held her husband, Aristides. ''All of us have prayed for him these weeks to be alive, but we didn't know. God gave Omar back to us - he knows nothing about war.'' 
 The contras also kidnapped Antonio Rodriguez from the same bus traveling between the villages of Siuna and Rosita, according to his family and human-rights officials. Mr. Rodriguez was not seen by a reporter, but people in a rebel camp said he is also being held in a border base near the Bocay and Coco rivers. 
 Human-rights officials estimate that at least 400 Nicaraguan families have, like the Navas family, had a relative kidnapped by the American-backed rebels. The practice now appears to be on the rise again as rebel units infiltrate Nicaragua anew and look for new recruits. 
 A State Department official, asked by telephone to comment on the practice, said, ''We oppose kidnapping people, and we've made that clear to the rebels.'' Kidnapping Was 'an Error' 
 The official appeared not to have been informed of the contra kidnappings reported to be occurring in Nicaragua despite a $3 million United States human-rights monitoring program for the rebels. 
 A senior rebel commander, Mike Lima, was asked why his men were still seizing people. The question was especially pointed as 30 peasants had just walked into the border camp in what appeared to be a genuinely voluntary decision to fight the Sandinistas they said they oppose. 
 In response, Mr. Lima described the kidnapping as ''an error,'' in which a young patrol commander had made the mistake of taking Mr. Navas and others to a secret rebel camp. There, he said, the senior commander ordered that the kidnapped men be held, rather than release them and risk disclosure of the rebels' location. 
 But Mr. Navas's feet were soon in such bad shape - a condition he says kept him from being drafted into the Sandinista army - that the rebels had to carry him in a sling for the last four-days of a march to a hidden base on the border, according to Mr. Lima. More Suffering for the Navases 
 The effect of the kidnapping on Mr. Navas's family and their community offers a sharp example of how the tactic of forcing people to fight hurts guerrillas in wars that depend on popular support. 
 The Navas family had already suffered at the hands of the Sandinistas because of the contra war. The family ran the village store in San Carlos on the Coco river until 1981, when the Sandinistas decided to destroy the town and remove its inhabitants, suspected of supporting Miskito Indian rebels. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Navas say they lost almost everything they owned. Mr. Navas, then 72, spent eight days in a State Security cell until the Sandinistas decided that he was not a contra. 
 The Sandinistas then put the couple into a grim relocation camp where, the Navases said, their children persuaded officials to let them take their parents to Managua. So Much Ill Fortune 
 The Sandinistas, who destroyed the couple's means of earning a living, have given them no assistance, Mrs. Navas said. She and her husband live off their children, eating beans and rice and wearing threadbare clothes and worn tennis shoes without laces. 
 Then, after so much ill fortune, the contras seized their son. 
 ''We are old people, and there is nowhere left for us to go,'' Mrs. Navas said. ''The Government moved us, and now the contras have taken Omar. There has been so much suffering.'' Their kidnapped son's wife and two children still live in Siuna, in the northern war zone. The family now worries that with their son's continuing absence, his family will soon have little to live on. 
 According to a number of witnesses, the effort at forced recruitment by the contras has done nothing to improve their already tarnished reputation in Siuna, where a rebel unit slit the throats of two agricultural consultants in 1985, according to a resident. Mr. Navas's Release Is Sought 
 Contra commanders told a reporter that Mr. Navas would be free to return to Nicaragua if he chooses, and a rebel human-rights official said there ''is an effort being made'' to see that Mr. Navas goes home. United States officials are aware of the case and are reportedly seeking Mr. Navas's release as well. But so far he has not appeared. 
 The last time a reporter saw him, Mr. Navas was sitting with bandaged feet in a small rebel base with almost 3,000 Sandinista troops preparing to attack. If the base was overrun, he would not have been able to flee. He had waved goodbye as a reporter left the base. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Navas have asked international relief officials for help, but they are very worried and say they do not know what to do next. Their plight is shared by hundreds of Nicaraguan families and will be shared by more in a war in which there appears to be no clearly defined mechanism for returning prisoners or refugees from guerrilla control. 
 The Sandinistas refuse to grant even minimal official recognition to the contras, making any exchange of prisoners or refugees in guerrilla hands especially difficult."
"17","BALLET: THE BOLSHOI, IN ''HIGHLIGHTS' PROGRAMS",54633,"|arts",6,7,1987,"19870706T000000",NA," 
 The ''Highlights'' ballet program was popularized, if not invented, as a genre by the Bolshoi Ballet when the company from Moscow made its American debut in New York in 1959. 
 Oddly, this format, with its mixture of excerpts, has been disparaged in recent years as an incoherent collection of bits and pieces, supposedly incapable of showing off a company's range. How wrong this can be was demonstrated with electrifying emphasis Saturday afternoon and evening at the Metropolitan Opera House: the ever-terrific new young Bolshoi dancers repeated, with some variations, the previously reviewed ''Highlights'' program of Friday night. Nerves had obviously dissipated - everyone danced better! 
 Lyudmila Semenyaka continued to hold the Met audience in the palm of her hand, this time with a monstre sacre type of performance in the ''Don Quixote'' pas de deux with Irek Mukhamedov, who gratifyingly revealed himself as an excellent and controlled classical dancer - anything but the mere athlete his spectacular jumps have connoted in contemporary works. His own performance in the first-act ''Spartacus'' excerpt Saturday night was now more powerful the second time around than on Friday. 
 Unlike the full version of the ballet to the Khachaturian score, this opening act had seemed anticlimactic on its own. On Saturday afternoon, magically and unexpectedly, a more classically styled dancer, Aleksei Fadeyechev, was able to achieve stunningly the declamatory force the title role had with its creator, Vladimir Vassiliev. This was great dancing, shaped to the utmost and accompanied by dramatic projection in the acting. 
 Each of these programs closes with the first act of ''Spartacus'' and opens with the first act of ''Romeo and Juliet,'' both choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich. 
 His opening view of Prokofiev's score succeeds marvelously on its own ground and with its rich Renaissance-red decor by Simon Virsaladze. It was interesting to see, Saturday night, Miss Semenyaka as Juliet to Andris Liepa's Romeo, again elegantly danced and deeply romantic. Exquisite in her skimming steps across the floor, aristocratic in her neo-classical line, Miss Semenyaka danced like a flowing stream. And yet the final balcony duet with Mr. Liepa became a sensuous sigh as her body floated into his embrace. 
 Yes, the Bolshoi dancers are sexy and there is no need to look far for the root of their appeal. The very physicality of their dancing contributes to this quality. More than the Kirov, they have conserved the supple-back ''plastique'' that became popular in Soviet ballet in the 1920's. 
 One of the prime exponents of this style is the exciting Nina Ananiashvili, who would have been a perfect protegee to Michel Fokine, and whose Black Swan pas de deux with Mr. Fadayechev Saturday evening had both incredible speed and a welcome softness. The program included the ''Corsaire'' pas de deux stolidly danced by Vitali Artyushkin and merely correctly danced by Alla Khaniashvili-Artyushkina. The music from the Arabian dance from Mr. Grigorovich's version of''The Nutcracker'' was used for an ''Indian'' duet for Mariya Zubkova and Aleksandr Valuyev - a hit with the audience and useful as a change of pace. 
 Mariya Bilova and Andrei Shakhin brought the frieze-like duet from Mr. Grigorovich's ''Legend of Love'' to life more than their predecessors and the Fokine ''Chopiniana'' waltz duet with Tatyana Golikova and Aleksei Dovgopoliy was decently performed. 
 Mr. Mukhamedov also partnered Nina Semizorova, a tough little dancer whose performance was on the sloppy side here, in the ''Don Quixote'' pas de deux. As a matter of fact, his dancing in his solo was even more polished here than when he partnered Miss Semenyaka. In the afternoon, he and Miss Semenyaka delighted the public with their Spanish mannerisms, which Mr. Mukhamedov later toned down in his more distanced rapport with Miss Semizorova. Miss Semenyaka, grinning and flouncing, spinning in her smooth pirouettes, got away with near-murder. She is New York's darling. 
 At the same matinee, Miss Semizorova showed her impressive lyrical style in Pyotr Gusev's staging of a pas de deux from the 1889 Petipa ballet, ''The Talisman.'' Aleksandr Vetrov was the windgod who danced with Miss Semizorova as Niriti -whose goddess mother had given her a star as talisman. None of this shows up, of course, in what looks like a conventional pas de deux full of deep curtsies for the ballerina. 
 Asaf Messerer's athletic ''Spring Waters'' duet, once the epitome of Bolshoi style and now danced by Leonid Nikonov and Inna Petrova, proved to be less than second nature to the current Bolshoi generation. Alla Mikhalchenko's Black Swan, with Mr. Fadeyechev, was a bit on the jerky side at the matinee but in the evening her Aegina in ''Spartacus,'' with a convincing Crassus from Aleksei Lazarev, was clearly etched. A special word for the gallant style of Yuri Posokhov's Paris in ''Romeo and Juliet,'' and the commitment the ensemble gives to the dueling scenes - these young men always come out swinging."
"18","Kerkorian Plan On Expansion",60746,"|business",29,7,1987,"19870729T000000",NA," 
 The Tracinda Corporation, the parent company of MGM/UA Communications, said today that it planned to make a variety of acquisitions in an effort to become a more diversified company. Tracinda, wholly owned by 
 Kirk Kerkorian, the investor, is the majority owner of MGM/ UA, the film studio, and MGM Grand Air, an all-first-class airline that plans to begin flights between New York and Los Angeles next month.

 As part of its plan, Tracinda named Terry Christensen to the new post of president. Mr. Christensen, 46 years old, had been a lawyer and consultant for Mr. Kerkorian. Tracinda also said it was moving its headquarters to Beverly Hills, Calif., from Las Vegas, Nev."
"19","A Long Trial in Spain on Fatal Tainted Food",62310,"|world",2,8,1987,"19870802T000000","|SPAIN"," 
 When the trial of 40 merchants accused of importing and selling tainted cooking oil that killed more than 600 people opened here in late March, it was expected to last six months. Court officials now estimate the trial will continue the rest of the year. 
 The defense in the proceeding, which goes into a month-long recess this week, contends that the cause of the deaths lies elsewhere, probably in tomatoes from Almeria in southern Spain that were sprayed with a combination of the pesticides Nemacur and Oftanol. But so far, as expected, most witnesses have attributed the casualties to denatured rapeseed oil intended for industrial use but sold as cooking oil. 
 Attention has centered on the testimony of Sir Richard Doll, the 74-year-old British epidemiologist and discoverer of the causal link between tobacco and lung cancer. He said the oil caused the deaths. 
 The mysterious illness broke out in the spring of 1981, mostly in the Madrid area. The symptoms included respiratory problems, skin disorders and a weakening of the body's immune system. The oil had been bought from street vendors by many low-income families, restaurants and others. 
 After an emotional start, with hundreds of surviving victims crowded outside the courtroom, high feelings have subsided. The court is wading through 250,000 pages of an investigation report and examining 2,500 people, including Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and his Deputy, Alfonso Guerra. 
 In the last month, however, public interest has revived with the arrival of scientific experts, Spanish and international. Approximately 50 experts have testified on possible causes. More than 100 people are scheduled to testify when the trial resumes in September. According to official figures, still disputed, more than 600 people have died and some 25,000 have been affected. 
 Nearly all experts testifying this month have said that the symptoms described by victims were not consistent with those known to be associated with poisoning by compounds such as pesticides. Though the experts say they do not know the precise cause of the toxic syndrome, one, Raphael Garrido Lesteche, told the court, ''I saw that when the oil was fully withdrawn and was no longer consumed, no more cases were produced.'' 
 Last week, Dr. Jose Baguena said in court that the herbicide paraquat may have contaminated the tanks in which the oil was transported. The theory met little support from other experts. 
 Last week a telegram sent by the World Health Organization to its committee of experts on toxic syndrome was read in court. It also links the disease to the ingestion of denatured rapeseed oil containing aniline, a poisonous, oily derivative of benzene. The message also stressed the correlation between the severity of the disease and the aniline content in the oil that patients ingested. 
 W.H.O. experts can not testify in this trial in an official capacity, though they may do so as individuals. 
 In his court appearance, Professor Doll explained that epidemiologists have established in many cases the causal relation between a disease and the toxic agent that caused it, without being able to specify the latter nor reproduce the full range of symptoms in animals. ''I'm satisfied that the oil was responsible,'' he said later."

"22","Your Money",66277,"|business",15,8,1987,"19870815T000000",NA," 
 DAVID EVANS, a businessman in Springdale, Ark., went shopping for jewelry recently as an anniversary present for his wife and eventually bought a pair of diamond earrings. But he realized right from the start that he had no expertise in judging the quality of diamonds, so he sought guidance from a specialist in the field. 
 ''It's hard for someone who knows nothing about jewelry to make a choice, other than to know what looks good,'' Mr. Evans said. ''So I went to a store where I have been buying for 19 years because they guarantee that the jewelry is what it claims to be. Perhaps I do pay a little more for that recognition, but I like the confidence.'' 
 Meeting and dealing with a person behind the counter of a store who is knowledgeable, reputable and ethical is the hope of every consumer like Mr. Evans in the market for fine jewelry. 
 ''Laymen are sometimes fooled by ripoff artists in stores,'' said Lance Stein, a partner at Grand Central Jewelers, a long-established jewelry store in New York. ''So in those cases you're not getting what you're being told you're getting.'' 
 One of the ways to determine if you are getting full value when buying a diamond is by using what jewelers call the four ''C's'': carat, cut, color and clarity. 
 Carat - a word derived from the carob seed - is the standard measurement for the weight of diamonds, other precious stones and semiprecious stones. One carat is divided into 100 points, so that a 10-point diamond weighs one-tenth of a carat. 
 Most diamonds are cut with a full 58 facets, or small, polished plane surfaces, in shapes that include the brilliant, the pear and the oval. Single-cut diamonds, however, have only 17 facets. 
 When checking the cut of a diamond, experts advise care, since some jewelers may display it under ''diamond lights'' - special illumination that distorts the amount of reflected light. A more accurate determination can be made when the stone is seen under standard fluorescent lighting. 
 The best color for a diamond is no color at all, because it then acts as a prism that lets light pass through the stone and creates a rainbow effect. The color grading scale ranges from the D grade of colorless, usually the most expensive, to the Z grade of light yellow. 
 As for clarity, the diamond should be viewed under 10-power magnification to determine if there are inclusions or blemishes, such as internal cracks and tiny bubbles. The clearest diamonds are called flawless or perfect, with the characterization ranging downward to those with the most imperfections and with eye-visible inclusions, called imperfect. 
 Since the typical jewelry customer does not have a 10-power magnifying glass or more than a modicum of knowledge about the four ''C's,'' picking the right dealer is probably the key decision when embarking on a shopping expedition. 
 A recommendation from a family member or friend could be the starting point, as could picking a jeweler belonging to the American Gem Society, a professional organization of jewelers who have agreed to meet certain standards and practices. 
 ''I would go to more than one store and say, 'I'm interested in a diamond for this purpose and have this much money to pay,' '' said William G. Underwood, president of the gem society. ''You should be shown items on both sides of your budget and told why the diamond is priced as it is.'' 
 The society awards titles, such as registered jeweler and certified gemologist, on an annual basis to jewelers who pass examinations. Someone designated a certified gemologist appraiser is considered qualified to offer appraisals of jewelry. 
 Anyone about to buy a diamond would probably do well to have it appraised by an independent appraiser who is not associated with either the dealer selling it or a competitor of that dealer. One such gem-grading laboratory is the Gemological Institute of America. 
 ''There isn't a diamond in the world that's like another because they're made by nature,'' said Gerry Hansen, president of the Jewelry Industry Council. ''In this market, you get what you pay for.'' 
 Mr. Hansen and other jewelry experts warn of the dangers that exist whenever individuals buy diamonds for investment purposes. Precious stones, they say, are more an investment in pleasure than a money-making instrument, especially when a quick sale is desired. The four-year slump in diamonds that lasted through the end of 1985 is an example of the difficulty faced by the average investor in deciding when to buy and when to sell investment diamonds. 
 ''In any resale business like this, there are markups from wholesale to retail,'' Mr. Hansen noted. ''The consumer buys the product at retail, but if you want to sell your diamond, a retailer will buy it at the wholesale price.''"
"23","The Stakes in the Philippines",69818,"|opinion",29,8,1987,"19870829T000000","|PHILIPPINES, REPUBLIC OF THE"," 
 Filipinos and Americans hasten to rally around President Aquino, faced with a deadly serious coup attempt, as rebels are driven from strongholds they seized in Manila and key locations around the country. The support surges up for good reason: The return of Ferdinand Marcos or his cronies won't work for the Philippines and won't wash with Americans. 
 There should be no doubt left about that. The only beneficiaries of a coup would be the gods of misery - would-be dictators and Communists. 
 Fortunately, it's too soon, only 18 months, to have forgotten the last days of the Marcos regime, Corruption was rampant, with Marcos cronies looting the country's assets. A Communist insurgency was rapidly winning recruits from the growing ranks of disaffected Filipinos. 
 Corazon Aquino has had her share of missteps since coming to power. She has disappointed supporters with excessive timidity on the vital question of land reform. She has permitted local abuse of patronage, and, just this week, badly misjudged popular reaction to sharp increases in the price of fuel. 
 Perhaps the coup plotters thought the resulting protests provided an opening. So far, the response of civilian and military loyalists appears to have proved them wrong. So far, Mr. Marcos's brazen solicitation of an invitation from the insurgents to return has gone unanswered. 
 These trappings of dark comedy should not obscure the essential point. The fall of the Aquino Government would be a disaster for the Philippines. It would enhance the Communist cause by again alienating those who now hold the political middle ground. It would fracture Manila's current good relations with Washington. 
 In the Philippines, as in South Korea, Washington's stake in democracy unites principle with strategic concerns. Seoul's edgy military regime now seems to be hedging its decision to allow legitimate protest. In either place, the greatest tragedy would be to have a successful democratic revolution in hand, only to see it slip, or be snatched, away."

 Sri Lanka accused India today of not doing its part to end ethnic violence on the island. It told Indian peacekeeping troops to put down clashes in one area or Sri Lankan security forces would do so. 
 President J. R. Jayewardene's office said he issued that warning at a meeting of Indian and Sri Lankan security officers to review the situation in the eastern district of Trincomalee. 
 In New Delhi, the Indian Government denied that Mr. Jayewardene had threatened to bar Indian peacekeeping troops from the district. 
 Clashes between Tamils and Sinhalese there are reported to have killed at least 18 people in five days, damaged 500 houses and shops and made 5,000 people homeless. 
 An Indian peacekeeping force of 8,000 soldiers and 1,000 paramilitary policemen is deployed in the north and east of Sri Lanka under a pact signed in July by India and Sri Lanka. 
 According to a statement from the President's office, Mr. Jayewardene said at the meeting that ''there had been some breakdown in cooperation between the two Governments'' on the military part of the agreement and that ''the Indian Government should rectify it.''"

"30","Wright Buildings: The Future and Past",85256,"|home|garden|style",22,10,1987,"19871022T000000",NA," 
 The agenda was twofold: to discuss the future of Frank Lloyd Wright's remaining buildings, and for those who lived in Wright-designed houses, to share restoration experiences. This weekend 160 Wright homeowners and 52 architectural historians, curators and academics met at the third annual ''Wright Places'' conference and tour, sponsored by the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio Foundation here. 
 ''This is a great opportunity to exchange information - these houses are old and in constant need of repair,'' said John Tilton, a Chicago designer and the owner of the 1909 J. Kibben Ingalls house in River Forest, Ill. 
 An estimated 360 private homes designed by Wright are still being lived in, and while much of the conference was devoted to the trials of restoration - which wood finishes to use, and how to repair art glass or leaky roofs - some philosophical issues were raised. 
 One was the fear that the current popularity of Wright's work, and the high prices that his furnishings and art glass have brought, would incline some owners to sell such artifacts. Last December, a high-backed spindle chair designed by Wright brought $198,000 at Christie's in New York. 
 ''The homeowners are very disturbed at the prices being paid,'' said Eric Lloyd Wright, the architect's 57-year-old grandson and an architect in Malibu, Calif. ''It makes it impossible for them to use them - the insurance alone is too high.'' 
 There is also the problem of architectural integrity. Following World War II, Wright's houses - with their open, horizontal spaces, cantilevered roofs and broad eaves - were out of favor. Wright-designed homes were treated according to the vagaries of their owners. Many were updated to meet the needs of a growing family. Additions were constructed, furnishings discarded, light fixtures removed and natural woodwork painted over, in an effort to modernize. ''Since 1900 these houses have been changed by each owner to reflect more contemporary styles of living,'' said David Hanks, a Wright historian and a New York decorative arts consultant who spoke at the conference. 
 The Mrs. Thomas Gale house here, for example, built in 1909, had only two owners before 1981, and had fallen into disrepair. 
 When Meg and Peter Klinkow became interested in owning a Wright home, they had not planned to take on a restoration as large as the one that the Gale house required. But six years and $60,000 later, their five-bedroom home is almost finished. While the dining room set had vanished, the house still had art glass windows and Wright-designed wall sconces. It needed a new roof, the woodwork had to be stripped and, reflecting the Klinkows' needs, a back porch and a basement family room were added. 
 ''We didn't think we'd get a Frank Lloyd Wright,'' said Ms. Klinkow, who is the director of the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio Foundation Research Center in Oak Park. ''I told my husband, 'Not that one.' It was such a mess.'' 
 Another question at the conference was the one of restoration integrity in Wright houses. Some historians advocated the replacement of rare and costly originals with reproductions. 
 ''If they're so important, as the art market is telling us, perhaps the museum is a good place for them, and reproductions are good for the house,'' Mr. Hanks said."
"31","TAMIL RESISTANCE WANES",86360,"|week in review",25,10,1987,"19871025T000000","|SRI LANKA, REPUBLIC OF|INDIA"," 
 INDIAN troops were winning the real estate in their battle with Tamil guerrillas last week, but their main political target, Velupillai Prabakaran, commander of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, reportedly escaped to fight another day. After a two-week siege, 8,000 Indian soldiers were said to have captured all but a few pockets of resistance in Jaffna, the northern stronghold of Sri Lanka's Tamil minority. Yesterday, the Indians said they were still encountering ''a lot of sniping.'' 
 More than 600 guerrillas and 100 Indian soldiers have been killed, Indian officials said. With few exceptions, however, journalists were barred from the area, so the claims could not be verified. With information tightly controlled, support for the rebels seemed to be waning among the tens of millions of Tamils of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu; such support was a major concern for the Indian Government. The Indians attacked anew after Mr. Prabakaran backed away from a promise to surrender weapons, and guerrilla attacks resumed against members of Sri Lanka's ethnic majority, the Sinhalese. 
 India has dispatched 20,000 soldiers, many of them ethnic Tamils, to enforce the agreement signed by the two countries July 29. Mr. Prabakaran had been promised a leading role in a more fully automonous regional government. Meanwhile, an estimated 500,000 refugees have fled from northern and eastern Sri Lanka in the last three weeks. Ninety thousand refugees from earlier phases of the four-year-old conflict were already living in camps.

"32","NASA Study Pays a Man to Rest",98129,"|science|health",1,12,1987,"19871201T000000",NA," 
 Richard Fitzpatrick has become a full-time couch potato, courtesy of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
 Mr. Fitzpatrick is spending 17 weeks in bed as part of a study to determine the effects of long-term weightlessness and the extent of progressive loss of bone mass suffered by astronauts. 
 The 45-year-old man, a former purchasing agent for a local business who was recruited for the study, has been on his feet only a few times since the third week of August. He said standing up has caused dizziness, leg cramps and a funny feeling in his feet. Low Pay, Little Work 
 For reading library books, watching television, eating snacks and taking it easy on his hospital bed, Mr. Fitzpatrick is paid $187.60 a week. 
 For NASA, the study is a vital to its effort to learn about the ability of humans to adapt to space, particularly for the long periods envisioned under the agency's planned space station program. 
 ''It's one of the important questions for the space station right now,'' said Dr. Victor Schneider, co-director of the study. ''If you have astronauts up for three months, you want to know if they recover and the effects over their careers.'' 
 The longest period United States astronauts have spent in space was 84 days during the Skylab 4 mission in 1974. In their time in orbit, the astronauts lost 4.5 percent to 7 percent of their bone mass, Dr. Schneider said. 
 ''All those who lost bone in Skylab were still down about that amount of bone five to seven years later,'' he said. Questions on Bone Loss 
 Researchers believe long-term bed rest affects bones in much the same way space flight does, but remain unsure what causes bone mass loss over time. 
 Scientists also say they are not sure whether humans ever regain bone mass lost in space. 
 Dr. Schneider believes recovery is possible through exercise, although a 10-week study at Methodist Hospital with one astronaut, William E. Thornton, has indicated that stretching or bicycle riding does not help."
"33","'EVER ET RAW MEAT?' AND OTHER WEIRD QUESTIONS",99402,"|arts|books",6,12,1987,"19871206T000000",NA," 
 IT seems to me that, in the minds of readers, writers actually exist to serve two purposes, and the more important may not be the writing of books and stories. The primary function of writers, it seems, is to answer readers' questions. These fall into three categories. The third is the one that fascinates me most, but I'll identify the other two first. 
 The One-of-a-Kind Questions: Each day's mail brings a few of these. Often they reflect the writer's field of interest - history, horror, romance, the American West, outer space, big business. The only thing they have in common is their uniqueness. Novelists are frequently asked where they get their ideas (see category No. 2), but writers must wonder where this relentless curiosity, these really strange questions, come from. 
 There was, for instance, the young woman who wrote to me from a penal institution in Minnesota. She informed me she was a kleptomaniac. She further informed me that I was her favorite writer, and she had stolen every one of my books she could get her hands on. ''But after I stole 'Different Seasons' from the library and read it, I felt moved to send it back,'' she wrote. ''Do you think this means you wrote this one the best?'' After due consideration, I decided that reform on the part of the reader has nothing to do with artistic merit. I came close to writing back to find out if she had stolen ''Misery'' yet but decided I ought to just keep my mouth shut. 
 From Bill V. in North Carolina: ''I see you have a beard. Are you morbid of razors?'' 
 From Carol K. in Hawaii: ''Will you soon write of pimples or some other facial blemish?'' 
 From Don G., no address (and a blurry postmark): ''Why do you keep up this disgusting mother worship when anyone with any sense knows a MAN has no use to his mother once he is weened?'' 
 From Raymond R. in Mississippi: ''Ever et raw meat?'' (It's the laconic ones like this that really get me.) I have been asked if I beat my children and/or my wife. I have been asked to parties in places I have never been and hope never to go. I was once asked to give away the bride at a wedding, and one young woman sent me an ounce of pot, with the attached question: ''This is where I get my inspiration - where do you get yours?'' Actually, mine usually comes in envelopes - the kind through which you can view your name and address printed by a computer - that arrive at the end of every month. 
 My favorite question of this type, from Anchorage, asked simply: ''How could you write such a why?'' Unsigned. If E. E. Cummings were still alive, I'd try to find out if he'd moved to the Big North. 
 The Old Standards: These are the questions writers dream of answering when they are collecting rejection slips, and the ones they tire of quickest once they start to publish. In other words, they are the questions that come up without fail in every dull interview the writer has ever given or will ever give. I'll enumerate a few of them: 
 Where do you get your ideas? (I get mine in Utica.) How do you get an agent? (Sell your soul to the Devil.) Do you have to know somebody to get published? (Yes; in fact, it helps to grovel, toady and be willing to perform twisted acts of sexual depravity at a moment's notice, and in public if necessary.) How do you start a novel? (I usually start by writing the number 1 in the upper right-hand corner of a clean sheet of paper.) How do you write best sellers? (Same way you get an agent.) How do you sell your book to the movies? (Tell them they don't want it.) What time of day do you write? (It doesn't matter; if I don't keep busy enough, the time inevitably comes.) Do you ever run out of ideas? (Does a bear defecate in the woods?) Who is your favorite writer? (Anyone who writes stories I would have written had I thought of them first.) There are others, but they're pretty boring, so let us march on. 
 The Real Weirdies: Here I am, bopping down the street, on my morning walk, when some guy pulls over in his pickup truck or just happens to walk by and says, ''Hi, Steve! Writing any good books lately?'' I have an answer for this; I've developed it over the years out of pure necessity. I say, ''I'm taking some time off.'' I say that even if I'm working like mad, thundering down homestretch on a book. The reason why I say this is because no other answer seems to fit. Believe me, I know. In the course of the trial and error that has finally resulted in ''I'm taking some time off,'' I have discarded about 500 other answers. 
 Having an answer for ''You writing any good books lately?'' is a good thing, but I'd be lying if I said it solves the problem of what the question means. It is this inability on my part to make sense of this odd query, which reminds me of that Zen riddle - ''Why is a mouse when it runs?'' - that leaves me feeling mentally shaken and impotent. You see, it isn't just one question; it is a bundle of questions, cunningly wrapped up in one package. It's like that old favorite, ''Are you still beating your wife?'' 
 If I answer in the affirmative, it means I may have written - how many books? two? four? - (all of them good) in the last - how long? Well, how long is ''lately''? It could mean I wrote maybe three good books just last week, or maybe two on this very walk up to Bangor International Airport and back! On the other hand, if I say no, what does that mean? I wrote three or four bad books in the last ''lately'' (surely ''lately'' can be no longer than a month, six weeks at the outside)? 
 Or here I am, signing books at the Betts' Bookstore or B. Dalton's in the local consumer factory (nicknamed ''the mall''). This is something I do twice a year, and it serves much the same purpose as those little bundles of twigs religious people in the Middle Ages used to braid into whips and flagellate themselves with. During the course of this exercise in madness and self-abnegation, at least a dozen people will approach the little coffee table where I sit behind a barrier of books and ask brightly, ''Don't you wish you had a rubber stamp?'' I have an answer to this one, too, an answer that has been developed over the years in a trial-and-error method similar to ''I'm taking some time off.'' The answer to the rubber-stamp question is: ''No, I don't mind.'' 
 Never mind if I really do or don't (this time it's my own motivations I want to skip over, you'll notice); the question is, Why does such an illogical query occur to so many people? My signature is actually stamped on the covers of several of my books, but people seem just as eager to get these signed as those that aren't so stamped. Would these questioners stand in line for the privilege of watching me slam a rubber stamp down on the title page of ''The Shining'' or ''Pet Sematary''? I don't think they would. 
 If you still don't sense something peculiar in these questions, this one might help convince you. I'm sitting in the cafe around the corner from my house, grabbing a little lunch by myself and reading a book (reading at the table is one of the few bad habits acquired in my youth that I have nobly resisted giving up) until a customer or maybe even a waitress sidles up and asks, ''How come you're not reading one of your own books?'' 
 THIS hasn't happened just once, or even occasionally; it happens a lot. The computer-generated answer to this question usually gains a chuckle, although it is nothing but the pure, logical and apparent truth. ''I know how they all come out,'' I say. End of exchange. Back to lunch, with only a pause to wonder why people assume you want to read what you wrote, rewrote, read again following the obligatory editorial conference and yet again during the process of correcting the mistakes that a good copy editor always prods, screaming, from their hiding places (I once heard a crime writer suggest that God could have used a copy editor, and while I find the notion slightly blasphemous, I tend to agree). 
 And then people sometimes ask in that chatty, let's-strike-up-a-conversa-tion way people have, ''How long does it take you to write a book?'' Perfectly reasonable question - at least until you try to answer it and discover there is no answer. This time the computer-generated answer is a total falsehood, but it at least serves the purpose of advancing the conversation to some more discussable topic. ''Usually about nine months,'' I say, ''the same length of time it takes to make a baby.'' This satisfies everyone but me. I know that nine months is just an average, and probably a completely fictional one at that. It ignores ''The Running Man'' (published under the name Richard Bachman), which was written in four days during a snowy February vacation when I was teaching high school. It also ignores ''It'' and my latest, ''The Tommyknockers.'' ''It'' is over 1,000 pages long and took four years to write. ''The Tommyknockers'' is 400 pages shorter but took five years to write. 
 Do I mind these questions? Yes . . . and no. Anyone minds questions that have no real answers and thus expose the fellow being questioned to be not a real doctor but a sort of witch doctor. But no one - at least no one with a modicum of simple human kindness - resents questions from people who honestly want answers. And now and then someone will ask a really interesting question, like, Do you write in the nude? The answer -not generated by computer - is: I don't think I ever have, but if it works, I'm willing to try it."
"34","Tax Law and Bond Market Head for Collision",100560,"|opinion",10,12,1987,"19871210T000000",NA," 
 To the Editor: 
 There has been some discussion of the impact on the stock market of recent changes in the taxation of capital gains (letters, Nov. 3, 20). Of greater significance is the impact of the tax law on the bond market, with grave negative implications for very broad sectors of American society. 
 It should be realized first that bond prices are inherently unstable. Typically, a bond's price moves opposite to interest rates. However, the percentage price change is not strictly proportionate to the percentage rate change. Rather, the ratio of price change to rate change increases as the price moves below par. In other words, the farther the price falls, the faster it falls. This price behavior is quite different from stocks, where the real value of corporate assets puts a floor under the share price and so tends to brake a price fall. 
 Formerly, the instability of bonds was counteracted by tax law. Thus, an investor purchasing a bond below par could look forward to receiving the difference between purchase price and par at maturity. When this gain, the so-called market discount, was taxed at a more favorable capital-gain rate, investors had an incentive to purchase discounted bonds. Thus, tax law put a prop under the bond market. 
 Beginning in 1984, tax law reclassified market discount as ordinary income, not capital gain. However, investors still had some opportunity for capital gain in bonds if they could accurately predict the interest rate cycle. Thus, the tax prop was not abolished by the 1983 tax law change. But the new tax law, by raising the capital-gain rate, takes away this prop. 
 A new proposal before Congress goes on to destabilize the bond market further. The law would require the investor to accrue the market discount over the life of the bond. This represents an extension of the tax treatment formerly given only to bonds originally issued at a discount. The effect is to collect a tax in the absence of a cash income. Since bond investors are concerned with nothing if not the time value of money, the law creates a powerful incentive to avoid discount bonds. As a result, the bond's price will have to fall even farther than formerly to attract buyers. 
 For investors concerned with the purchasing power of money, the tax law provides a second incentive to avoid discount bonds. By requiring accrual taxation, the Government is collecting a tax in today's dollars on a benefit to be received only in future inflated dollars, perhaps as far as 30 years hence. Clearly, this is a gouging of the investor. Note that rising inflation and falling bond prices usually go together, so that this second effect will be added to the first. In short, where tax law formerly mitigated the instability of the bond market, it now amplifies that instability. 
 The implications are profound. Once investors realize their bond portfolios are riskier, they will doubtless demand a higher return. The cost of borrowing will go up. For American business, the bond market represents the principal source of external capital (unlike the stock market, which is not a major source of new capital). Industry will find its cost of capital increased, possibly hurting international competitiveness. For Government, higher borrowing costs will increase the cost of the national debt and lead to deeper budget deficits. The middle class will find mortgage costs higher. 
 Despite these negative implications, the Government will probably receive no real tax benefit from the new law. This conclusion follows from the ability of investors to shelter income behind the amortization of premiums on bonds purchased above par. Consequently, the revenue gain on discount bonds will be more or less offset by the revenue loss on premium bonds. 
 The interaction of the tax law and bond market is a disaster waiting to happen. This small but vital aspect of the law deserves rethinking from the ground up. NICOLO G. TORRE  San Francisco, Nov. 27, 1987  The writer, a mathematician, manages investment portfolios."

 A TOURISM official for one Caribbean country said candidly that it had so far been a ''soft'' season, and she did not mean the weather. But her unhappiness at the slowness of business translates into good news for people who find themselves sick of winter at the end of February but still with no reservations for a sunshine fix. 
 A trip to a warm island is still possible to put together from now to April 15, the end of the Caribbean high season. There are rooms available in hotels and smaller lodgings, and there are airplane seats, too. Some officials said that the stock market plunge in October caused cancellations in high-priced hotels - although some of these rooms were later reported rebooked - but a number of places report some vacancies across the board. 
 The hoteliers may not be prepared to give a flat-out discount, but most have vacancies and will welcome the business, perhaps even agreeing to upgrade accommodations. For example, one couple we met in Tobago had arrived to use a time-sharing condominium but found it too noisy and asked for and got a cabana on the beach at no added cost. 
 The availability of rooms and airplane seats at this time of year also arises from the late onset of cold weather, according to Joe N. Garzilli, president of Flyfaire, a wholesale tour packager. ''The winter just started out slow for the Caribbean travel business,'' he said in an interview. ''The stock market events in October, or more precisely, the media perceptions of the stock market events, held things down. Then the 2-degree weather was a little late in arriving. But when it did arrive, we got busy, stock market or no.'' 
 Mr. Garzilli suggested that those desperate for the sun consider the Bahamas as well as the Caribbean. ''Normally, you could not expect to get space in the Bahamas from late February into March,'' he said. ''That is when the Bahamas weather is at its best. But the slowness of the start in Caribbean sales meant that the overflow that usually fills up the Bahamas did not come along as expected. Prices are a little less, for both air and land, in the Bahamas, too.'' 
 Almost all those who gave advice on last-minute plans for the islands said that there was space in their area - perhaps not in that perfect place, they said, but space. The occupancy rate was often reported at 80 to 90 percent. Barbados used the figure of 90 percent full, but as Peter Rothholz, a spokesman, pointed out, the island has 12,000 beds for tourists, and at 90 percent full this would leave 1,200 beds available. On a smaller island, 10 percent availability might not allow much choice. 
 A spokesman for the French West Indies, Myron Clement, said in mid-February that he had just returned and that the season, while good, had not been up to hopes in his area, so there was space for a spur-of-the-moment visitor. He stayed on an island just off Guadeloupe, Les Saintes (Iles des Saintes), which he described as a relaxed, out-of-the-way place, much like St. Barthelemy a dozen years ago. The island is reached by a short boat or plane trip from Guadeloupe. 
 The French West Indies Tourist Board, through the French Government Tourist Office, will provide United States phone numbers for agents representing hotels in its area. The address is 610 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 11020; 212-757-1125 (there is no 800 number for this organization). Two West Indian hotel chains may be reached directly: Mondotels at 212-757-0225 or 800-847-4249, and Pullman International Hotels at 212-757-6500 or 800-223-9862. 
 The St. Kitts and Nevis tourist association reported an ample number of rooms available at a range of prices. A particularly good buy appeared to be the Frigate Bay Beach Hotel in St. Kitts, a short walk to a beach, which said it had doubles available at $95 a night. The Fairview Inn at Basseterre on St. Kitts had doubles at $70 a night but it is not on the beach. The Rest Haven, a small beachfront hotel near Charlestown on Nevis, had double rooms at $60 a night. Pinney's Beach Hotel, in Charlestown, had doubles at $130 with breakfast and dinner. Up the scale some, Cliffdwellers Cottages near Charlestown had doubles, with breakfast and dinner, at $210. The St. Kitts and Nevis tourist association is at 414 East 75th Street, New York, N.Y. 10021, 212-535-1234. 
 In discussing rooms in the higher-price brackets, several Caribbean experts mentioned new or revamped hotels as possibilities, on the premise that they had not built up a return clientele to tide them through a slow year. For Anguilla, Joan Medhurst, a spokeswoman, pointed to Coccoloba Plantation, which has just opened with 51 rooms and suites on a two-mile beach. E. David Brewer, general manager of Coccoloba, said that he had been running at 75 percent occupancy with bigger rooms at $350 a night and $290 for smaller rooms, both with breakfast. Inquiries through 212-840-6636 or 800-351-5656. 
 In Barbados, which appears to have had a busy season, the Royal Pavilion, north of Holetown in St. James's Parish on the leeward coast, was mentioned as a new luxury hotel. It opened on Dec. 15 with 75 oceanfront ''junior suites'' and a three-bedroom villas. The suites - a bedroom, bath and balcony - go for $275 a night, and there was some space in March. Reservations: 809-422-4444 or 809-422-5555. 
 SOME officials were coy about it and some were blunt, but all said that many hotels that had in earlier years sold only for a Saturday-to-Saturday week at a time are now willing to let rooms for four days and three nights. Mr. Garzilli said that a traveler flexible enough to accept a Tuesday or Wednesday arrival and departure might also find doors opening. ''Many places are trying to space out their arrival days,'' he said, and judging by my own recent Caribbean trip, the Saturday move-out and clean-up crush stretches a hotel's staff. 
 Trinidad and Tobago's tourist board in New York reports space available across the board for March. The Kapok Hotel, a modest but clean 71-room place just off the main park in very urban Port of Spain, Trinidad, has double rooms available at $68 a night. On the weekend, many people from Trinidad take a brief plane trip to Tobago, where almost everything is beach-oriented. The Crown Reef, which you can walk to from the airport, has double rooms facing the ocean available in March at $120 a night. The hotel is on a steep rock, but it adjoins Store Bay and is also a pleasant half-hour walk to Pigeon Point, a long, glorious beach. Information on these two hotels and others in the same country: Executive Resorts, 800-551-4000 or 305-595-0100. 
 Tourism officials representing St. Thomas and St. John, United States Virgin Islands, reported a slower season than last year's, which was a ''banner year,'' but said that bookings jumped when ''Good Morning America'' broadcast from there in the first week in February. Since then, Tom Bennett of the St. Thomas-St. John Hotel Association said, bookings have been running at 80 percent and the available rooms are in all price categories. The islands maintain offices in New York, Miami, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington. The number in New York is 212-582-4520. 
 Getting a flight will prove easier if you don't tie yourself down to a Saturday departure and a Sunday return. Also, if you cannot find a direct flight, you should investigate what is available out of Miami, assuming you can get to Miami. The farther south in the Caribbean you go, you will improve your chances of good weather. 
 A travel agent can work out a plan for you, or you can start by calling some airlines to find a flight to an area that interests you. Many airlines sell packages including flights and hotels at prices that are a saving over buying air and land accommodations separately. You could also call directory assistance for the Caribbean, 809-555-1212, and ask for the tourist board or hotel association for the country that you want."
"37","Recital: Ax and Ma Perform",123296,"|arts",29,2,1988,"19880229T000000",NA," 
 A DECADE ago, at the height of the vaunted chamber-music boom, much was made of soloists banding together for recitals. Since then, comparatively few teams of stellar soloists have decided to cultivate chamber playing as an art, and to make it part of their artistic agendas. The cellist Yo-Yo Ma and the pianist Emanuel Ax are among this minority, and in recent years, their collaboration has yielded several magnificent recordings. 
 The centerpiece of their Avery Fisher Hall recital Sunday afternoon was the Shostakovich Sonata (Op. 40), a work composed in 1934, the same year as the ill-fated opera ''Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk.'' While hardly as politically volatile a work, the sonata is certainly anxious and impassioned, and it balances elements of folksy nationalism with a few nods toward the modern approach to harmony and structure that the Soviet Government ultimately scorned as formalism. 
 For Mr. Ax and Mr. Ma, the stress was on a kind of hushed, introspective lyricism in the first and third movements, tempered with a tempestuousness that burst forth in the second movement and the finale. In the Largo, particularly, they took a perilously slow tempo - one that would have disintegrated in less secure hands, but which sounded all the more plangent here. 
 The Brahms Sonata in F major (Op. 99) was given an equally transcendent reading, richly textured and deeply felt, yet also precise and firmly controlled. In both these works, as well as Stravinsky's somewhat more astringent ''Suite Italienne,'' Mr. Ax and Mr. Ma reaffirmed their reputations as sensitive colorists, secure technicians and thoughtful interpreters."

"42","N.B.A. Playoffs; Celtics Get Even in Odd Way",150081,"|sports",31,5,1988,"19880531T000000",NA," 
 The adjectives used to describe today's Boston Celtic-Detroit Piston game weren't the ones usually heard in locker rooms after playoff games. 
 ''Bizarre, crazy,'' said Kevin McHale, the Celtics' power forward. 
 ''Weird,'' said Chuck Daly, the Pistons' coach. 
 ''Most unusual,'' Jimmy Rodgers, the Celtics' assistant coach, said of the game that the Celtics won, 79-78, on a Dennis Johnson free throw with 8 seconds left to tie the four-of-seven- game series at 2-2. 
 It might have been easier to say it belonged among the worst played games in National Basketball Association history. 
 And there were plenty of statistics and odd happenings in the 2-hour-26- minute game to support that claim. 
 To begin with, the Pistons, leading by 8-4 the first quarter, missed their next 20 shots before Dennis Rodman scored on a driving layup 10 minutes 11 seconds later. 
 The combined 26 points in the opening quarter by both teams - 10 by Detroit and 16 by Boston - was the lowest total in a playoff quarter since the Chicago Bulls (13) and the Pistons (17) combined for 30 points on April 5, 1974. 
 Not only did the Pistons set a club low in the first quarter, they matched it in the fourth quarter. 
 The Pistons shot only .167 for the first quarter, .288 for the half and .333 for the game. The Celtics tossed in a 14-point third quarter in which they shot .214, Boston shot .400 for the game. 
 Among the strange events were Adrian Dantley trying to inbound the ball to John Salley for an alley-oop only to have his pass go through the basket. Since the ball came from out of bounds it didn't count. 
 There were consecutive air balls seconds apart by Bill Laimbeer, who led the Pistons with 29 points, and Larry Bird, who had 20 to lead the Celtics. 
 Bird was called for a technical foul, a rarity, when he complained about being charged with a fourth foul with 6:41 left in the third quarter. He spent the rest of the period on the bench. 
 And there was the controversial finish. 
 After Johnson made one of two free throws to put the Celtics ahead by 79-78, the Pistons called timeout. When the huddle broke, Isiah Thomas threw the inbounds pass to Laimbeer, who passed up an open shot from the top of the key and got the ball instead to Joe Dumars. The Piston guard, the hero of Game 3 with 29 points but who had made only one of nine shots to that point, fired up a 10-foot jumper. Some thought the ball fell short before it was grabbed by Robert Parish. Others thought it was goaltending.  ''I don't know,'' said Daly, obviously disturbed by his team's play, ''I'm not in the officiating business.'' 
 Ed Rush, one of the two officials, said: ''The prerequisite for goaltending is that the ball has to have a chance to go into the basket. The defensive player, Robert Parish, pulled the ball straight down. As he did, the ball ticked the front of the rim.'' 
 ''So was it goaltending?'' he was asked again. 
 ''It was short,'' Rush said. ''The ball was clearly outside the rim. It would not have gone into the basket, therefore it was definitely not goaltending.'' 
 The victory that restored the homecourt advantage to the Celtics, broke a nine-game Boston losing streak at the Silverdome. The Pistons now must win a game at Boston Garden, where they have lost 21 of their last 22 games, to win the series. The one victory, however, was last Wednesday. 
 ''It was a defensive struggle to say the best,'' said Daly, ''It was game in which both teams struggled to score, probably because of the intensity of both teams. What hurts most is that they got a split here and that's what they were here to do. Now we start over with a three-game series.'' 
 Bird, who has been shooting badly in the series (.351 going into the game), had one short span when he looked like the Bird of old when a game is on the line. He scored 7 points in 84 seconds at the start of the fourth quarter on three straight jumpers, including a 3-pointer, to slice the Piston lead to 68-67. 
 ''I felt good after the rest,'' Bird said. ''I felt like starting the game over, rather than finishing it.'' 
 Bird was also critical of Laimbeer for passing up the final shot of the game and passing the ball to Dumars. 
 ''I guarantee you I would have taken that shot,'' Bird said. ''I would have taken the shot even if I would have missed 300 of them. He even surprised Dumars by passing it to him.'' ----Daly's Contract to End Under an unusal expiration date, negotiated two years ago, Daly's coaching contract with the Pistons will end Tuesday night. ''I guess they didn't think this would go this far,'' the Piston coach said. ''I guess they will continue to pay at the same rate I have been getting.'' 
 Daly and the Pistons have been at odds over a new contract for some time. ''They just won't come to an agreement,'' he said before the game. Daly said his average salary for the five seasons he has coached the Pistons was $185,000. 
 Jack McCloskey, the general manager, said: ''Chuck has a very lucrative contract in his pocket when he is ready to sign it. His agent wants to wait until after the playoffs.''"

"45","Construction Spending Rose 1.1% in May After April Dip",158252,"|business",2,7,1988,"19880702T000000","|UNITED STATES"," 
 Construction spending advanced 1.1 percent in May as strength in office and factory construction offset weakness in other areas. 
 The Commerce Department said today that building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $407.1 billion in May after a dip of two-tenths of 1 percent in April. 
 The May gain, the strongest since a 2.8 percent rise in March, came entirely from increases in nonresidential construction, which rose 4.3 percent, to an annual rate of $98.9 billion. 
 The increase was led by a 7.8 percent advance in office construction, which pushed this category up by 11 percent over May 1987, and a 7.7 percent advance in factory construction, where activity was 22.8 percent higher than a year ago. Office Sector Strong 
 Analysts said the rise in office construction, after a sustained period of weakness, reflected strong activity in the Northeast and some other sections of the country and a halt to the severe decline in building in the Southwest, which has been suffering economically from lower oil prices. 
 ''Cities such as Chicago, New York, Boston and Washington, D.C., are enjoying good economic growth and a fair amount of office construction,'' said Richard Peach, senior economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. ''This is happening while the sharp declines in other areas have at least bottomed out.'' 
 Mr. Peach said the big jump in factory construction reflected the capital spending boom as manufacturers rush to expand capacity to meet sharply higher export demand for American-made goods. Residential Building Weakens 
 Residential construction fell 1 percent during May, to an annual rate of $193.4 billion, reflecting a 1.3 percent drop in construction of single-family homes, which offset a 2.4 percent rise in the smaller apartment sector. Analysts do not expect much strength in this area during the year, particularly because of high vacancy rates for apartments and the loss of tax advantages for investing in residential real estate. 
 Government construction projects edged down three-tenths of 1 percent in May, to an annual rate of $78.9 billion. Highway construction, the biggest segment in the government sector, posted a 7.4 percent decline. 
 The various changes left overall construction spending 2.3 percent higher than it was a year ago."

 Q. How fast do fingernails grow? 
 Do they grow faster in summer?  A. Fingernail growth averages out to about a tenth of a millimeter a day, according to Lawrence A. Norton, M.D., clinical professor of dermatology at the Boston University School of Medicine. Toenails are about a half to a third slower, he said, and drugs or disease can change the growth rate. 
 ''There are differences from finger to finger,'' Dr. Norton went on. ''The middle and fourth finger tend to grow a little faster than than the fifth and the thumb. That's a Trivial Pursuit question, believe it or not.'' 
 ''Nails grow faster in summer, some research indicates, while winter and a cold environment tend to slow nail growth,'' he added. 
 ''Other studies seem to find that the right-hand fingers grew faster than the left, which might be tied to handedness, and that stimulation, such as massage, helps them grow faster. People with the neurotic habit tic of rubbing a digit would find that the nail they rubbed grew faster.'' 
 Contrary to childhood myth, nails do not continue to grow after death, he said. ''That is an optical illusion,'' he explained. ''Tissues around the nail tend to shrink away from the hard nail after death, giving the impression of something still growing.''

 Steven A. Pagones, who has been accused of participating in a sexual attack on Tawana Brawley, made an appeal today that was unusual for a grand jury witness. He asked that his accusers and Miss Brawley be subpoenaed. 
 ''You have not heard from the three men who claim they know what happened and from the one young lady who obviously knows what happened,'' Mr. Pagones said in a statement to the panel that he later made public. ''If you end your investigation without subpoenaing them, how can it be said that you have done everything to get to the bottom of this?'' 
 Mr. Pagones, 26 years old, an assistant district attorney in Dutchess County, volunteered to appear without immunity in an effort to detail his whereabouts from Nov. 24 to Nov. 28, the four days Miss Brawley, 16, of Wappingers Falls, was missing. 
 The Brawley family's advisers, C. Vernon Mason and Alton H. Maddox Jr, lawyers from New York City, and the Rev. Al Sharpton have accused state officials of a covering up the involvement of law-enforcement officials in what they say was a racially motivated kidnapping and sexual assault of Miss Brawley. They have not displayed evidence to support the contentions, and Miss Brawley and the family have withheld their cooperation from the inquiry. Request for Report 
 Thus, Mr. Pagones, who is white, said he thought it was necessary to come forward. ''I am here to prove myself innocent of charges made only at press conferences and on television,'' he said in his statement. He also gave the grand jury the names of a dozen witnesses, who, he said, would help exonerate him, and some of them were interviewed today. 
 Mr. Pagones also asked the panel, which is expected to end five months of work in the next two weeks, to make its final report public. A grand jury is not compelled to do so, but can issue reports under three provisions, including when an official seeking to clear his name makes such a request. Attorney General Robert Abrams, the special prosecutor in the case, said Mr. Pagones's request would be considered. 
 Mr. Pagones arrived to testify shortly after 10 A.M. and finished after 1 P.M. As he left the armory where the grand jury meets, he said: 
 ''I've done everything I can possibly do. I've answered their questions. I've waived my constitutional right to immunity.'' 
 His testimony apparently pleased Mr. Abrams, who was on hand. He had often asked Mr. Pagones to testify and in a statement called the appearance a ''significant milestone.'' 
 ''His desire to assist our investigation,'' Mr. Abrams said, ''contrasts sharply with the stubborn refusal to cooperate by the Brawley family and their advisers.''"

"52","Making a Safer Blow-Dryer: Progress, but at a Snail's Pace",174486,"|style",27,8,1988,"19880827T000000",NA," 
 At a time when people are grumbling about the quality of small electric appliances, many manufacturers are not listening. Or so it seems, judging by the flimsy toasters, corn poppers, hair dryers and other disposable appliances that have given plastic and tin a bad name. 
 Companies contend that, considering the low prices, product quality is actually high and that market forces discourage innovation. 
 ''Profit margins are very small and do not permit much advertising,'' said Wayne R. Smith, a spokesman for the Sunbeam Appliance Company in Downers Grove, Ill., a subsidiary of Allegheny International. ''So if you can't tell the consumer about product improvements, you do not do much research and development into safety or any other area.'' 
 The evolution of hand-held hair dryers, the kind known as blow-dryers that were first marketed 17 years ago by the Conair Corporation of Stamford, Conn., provides troubling insights into the slow pace of safety improvements. 172 Deaths in 11 Years ''There are 15 to 20 electrocutions a year involving hair dryers, and half involve children who pull hair dryers into the tub with their rubber ducks,'' said James V. Lacey, the general counsel to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a Federal agency. In the past 11 years, hair dryers have been associated with 172 deaths and 88 severe injuries. 
 On Aug. 10, the commission voted to start working with Underwriters Laboratories, the nonprofit organization that writes safety standards for manufacturers, to make blow-dryers completely safe when immersed in water. If manufacturers do not voluntarily improve their products, the commission's next step will be to consider mandatory standards, Mr. Lacey said. 
 Joe Bhatia, a spokesman for Underwriters Laboratories in Northbrook, Ill., said in an interview that safety improvements could come as early as 1990, if engineers can agree on a design that can be mass-produced. 
 Blow-dryers have twice presented unexpected dangers. In 1979, the safety commission recalled 18 million dryers after it was discovered that they spewed potentially carcinogenic asbestos fibers. 
 By 1982, another health hazard had become clearly associated with blow-dryers: electrocution. The 110 deaths and 50 injuries reported between 1977 and 1982 fell into two categories: adults who accidentally knocked the dryers into a sink or tub of water, and children under 10 years old who tried to play with the dryers while bathing. The commission found that most adults erroneously believed the dryers were safe around water so long as the power switch was off. 
 A typical case, reported in 1982, involved 3-year-old Scott Cayton of Elyria, Ohio, who was electrocuted after he pulled a dryer into the bathtub. The dryer was plugged in but turned off. 
 Dr. R. David Pittle, the technical director of Consumer Reports magazine and a member of the safety commission from 1973 to 1982, said: ''Hair dryer manufacturers would come to commission meetings and say, 'We don't want to talk about electrocutions.' '' They didn't want to scare people anymore about their products.'' 
 Manufacturers, who sell about 15 million hair dryers a year, preferred warning labels to costlier safety features. Essentially, the labels told people not to drop the dryers into water accidentally. 
 In June 1982, Dr. Pittle wrote to manufacturers, suggesting that they could save 20 lives a year with such simple improvements as waterproofing blow-dryer switches. The letter drew attention, and ''several months later,'' Dr. Pittle recalled, ''some major manufacturers and Underwriters Laboratories had a meeting in which they agreed to upgrade the U.L. standard to include two of four fixes I suggested in my letter.'' 
 But he added: ''They gave themselves an incredible lead time before the standard would become effective: Oct. 1, 1987. It was very, very disappointing.'' 
 The industry maintains that the time was needed for retooling. 
 The new U.L. standard requires that blow-dryers have waterproof switches and cords, which makes them safe when immersed with the operating switch turned off. But the new features will not prevent electrocutions when dryers are immersed when the switch is turned on. 
 Some manufacturers contend that they are being penalized for consumers' carelessness. ''Manufacturers were dragged kicking and screaming to the altar on this change,'' said one company official who agreed to be quoted only if his name was not used. ''We probably would not have have made the change without a new industry standard.'' 
 But two companies - Sunbeam and Clairol, a division of Bristol-Myers -were shipping dryers that met the new standard before last fall's deadline. Under U.L. rules, companies can continue selling older models manufactured before Oct. 1, 1987. 
 Sunbeam's Safe Idea hair dryer, which sells for about $16 and was introduced a year ahead of the deadline, exceeds the U.L. standard because its switch is difficult for children to operate. But the safety features added $2 to $4 to the retail price, and that apparently hurt sales. Sunbeam has now withdrawn from the personal-care-product market and is selling off its inventory of Safe Idea dryers. 
 Conair, the industry leader, is preparing to manufacture a new dryer, Model LS1, that will be safe when immersed, whether the switch is on or off, said Frank Lindsey, the company's vice president for marketing. The dryer, which will have a water-sensitive device that will shut off the power, will sell for about $25 and will be available in about six months, Mr. Lindsey said.  NEW MODEL OR OLD? CLUES ARE FEW 
 Shopping for a safer blow-dryer, one that meets the Underwriters Laboratories standards that went into effect last Oct. 1, may be frustrating. 
 Only Sunbeam promotes this improvement on its packaging, but its Safe Idea dryer is no longer being produced, so remaining models may be difficult to find. 
 The boxes for Conair's new models carry three lines of tiny print, shown magnified here. 
 Other manufacturers give no clues on their packaging about whether the dryer is a new or older model, and you can't tell by looking whether electrical parts have been waterproofed. 
 The U.L. logo on the package won't help shoppers distinguish between models, either. Manufacturers are allowed to sell the blow-dryers they produced before the standard went into effect, and they too carry the U.L. logo. 
 Why the reticence about the new features? Experts say companies tend to downplay safety improvements, partly because such improvements may imply that earlier models were defective and partly because the makers don't want to be stuck with inventories of older designs.

"54","The Fallen Stalin Remains On a Pedestal in Hometown",181565,"|world|front page",22,9,1988,"19880922T000000","|UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS (USSR)|GORI (USSR)"," 
 High and huge on its granite base here stands the last Soviet statue of Josef Stalin. Like the songs Gori children sing about him - ''Little Gori is great: It gave birth to Stalin'' - the statue is a tribute to the visceral loyalty he still commands in his native town. 
 The statue's endurance, however, is a tribute to something else: the grudging tolerance of Communist Party officials still grappling with a new era of political pluralism. 
 For when rumors swept the town two years ago that Communist Party authorities had ordered the 40-foot statue removed, dozens of residents in this textile-producing town of 60,000 surrounded the monument in a loose, protective cordon. A Vigil of Three Days 
 ''For three nights and three days we sat there,'' said Maya Takalova, 45 years old, a Gori resident. The citizens did not leave until a local party official denied the rumors, said Mrs. Takalova and a friend who also took part in the demonstration. 
 Things were different 30 years earlier when a group of students in the Georgian Republic's capital, Tbilisi, demonstrated to protect another statue of Stalin during another period of destalinization. That time, the protesters were met with soldiers and guns. 
 The graves of two teen-agers who died in the gunfire that ended the demonstration on March 9, 1956, are carefully tended by a cemetery groundsman in Tbilisi, who said: ''Wait 100 years. There will still never be another man like him on our whole globe.'' Memory's Strong Grip 
 Despite two years of increasingly sharp press criticism of Stalin, encouraged by the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, memory of the dead leader's iron control has a stronger grip on many Georgian spirits than the living leader's logic. 
 Asked whether she would prefer Mr. Gorbachev or Stalin as the leader of her country, Mrs. Takalova said, ''Stalin, of course.'' 
 Stalin's picture appears but once or twice in the newly issued photo books about World War II sold in Georgian bookstores, but bootleg copies of his photograph, in full military ragalia, can be obtained on the streets for the asking. 
 ''There was justice,'' said Iliyo Palelashvili, a 77-year-old Gori resident who served as a rank and file soldier during the war. ''There were real laws back in Stalin's time. If we hadn't had those laws, we wouldn't have won the war.'' 
 But his adulation is not shared by most of the republic's intellectual elite, whose predecessors were virtually wiped out in Stalin's purges. 
 Here, where feuds are sharp, the purges settled not only the political but also the personal scores of Stalin and his fellow Georgian, the secret police commander Lavrenti T. Beria. A Collection of Tributes 
 ''It's just the older generation who still revere him,'' said Elizbar Dzhavelidze, editor of the Georgian-language weekly Literary Georgia, which carries a regular feature highlighting the fate of Stalin's victims. 
 In late 1986, the first powerful statement of the anti-Stalinist sentiment that would soon dominate Soviet culture was the film ''Repentance,'' by the Georgian director Tengiz Abuladze, which was released after two years of censorship. 
 But paradoxically, it is the policies of Mr. Gorbachev - a leader bent on freeing the Soviet system from the political, psychological and economic straitjackets of Stalinism - that have given Stalinists in Georgia a little room to breathe. 
 While printed praise of Stalin is rare even here, it is not unknown. Criticism, another Georgian-language newspaper, printed a collection of tributes to Stalin last month. 
 Private symbols of reverence, from oil portraits to gear shift knobs made from busts of Stalin, are easy to spot. A Temple to Stalin 
 Private expression, however, is one thing. Public expression - especially in the form of the Stalin Museum in Gori - is another. 
 Heavy with columned solemnity, the museum sits like a temple at the end of a pretty greensward along Stalin Avenue. Next to it sits Stalin's personal train car, and in front of that, under an extravagant roof supported by columns, sits the two-room house in which he was born 109 years ago. 
 The museum, whose closing was announced last summer but not put into effect until two weeks ago, is redoing its exhibits. Down the road, the town's military museum remains open, exhibiting one larger-than-life plaster statue of Stalin, a bas-relief, and two smaller statuettes. 
 ''Any small city like ours would be proud that a man had been born there who left some footprint on history,'' said Malkhaz Gochashvili, 34, as he sat in his office at the Gori city Communist Party headquarters. But Mr. Gochashvili, who heads the organizational division of the city party, was circumspect when it came to his own opinions of his town's most famous native son. 
 ''I am a Communist,'' he said. ''I follow the party line.'' 
 The ever-shifting character of that line was evident in some historical works on his shelf, including a tabloid compilation of official announcements and tributes printed at Stalin's death. 
 Inside a cover with a full-page picture of Stalin, it said, ''Stalin's immortal name will live forever in the hearts of the Soviet people and of all progressive mankind.'' 'Stalin Is Our Neighbor' 
 Forever, perhaps, but in what context? 
 Although the continuing re-examination of Soviet history has forced Soviet schools to cancel history exams until new texts can be published, students in Gori still use the old texts, which praise Stalin's role as a military leader. 
 ''We studied with the old books,'' said Georgi Kotolashvili, 18, as he stood with two friends near the Stalin Museum in Gori. 
 Georgi Tedeluri, also 18, said ''we don't agree'' with the current criticism of Stalin, adding: ''We live here, near the museum. We like to say that Stalin is our neighbor. We love him.'' 
 Lea Savinidze, a Gori housewife who has raised five children to respect the leader they never knew, said: ''We can speak freely. General Stalin is like a god to us.'' 
 ''We all in this town have his picture in the center of our homes,'' she said. ''On Dec. 21, Stalin's birthday, we drink toasts to him as if he were alive.''"
"55","LOVERS WERE BESIDE THE POINT",182486,"|arts|books",25,9,1988,"19880925T000000",NA," 
 MEN  By Margaret Diehl.  282 pp. New York:  Soho Press. $17.95. 
 The erotic appeal of strangers tends to haunt us, if at all, when we are walking down a crowded street. There is something about the sensuality of an unknown body that causes old seams in the soul to creak with life. 
 Stella, the narrator and main character of Margaret Diehl's first novel, is a woman who sets out to tap this reservoir of strangers. With her boyfriend safely drunk at home, she goes into the night to pick up men solely to satisfy a desire that seems to go far beyond sex into a realm of intense loneliness. Her list of men is long: carpenters, architects, wounded Vietnam veterans. It almost becomes a 1980's version of the catalogue of ships in the ''Iliad.'' 
 But when it comes right down to it, men, no matter how glorified they are in the title, are beside the point. Sex, for Stella, is like practicing for a revelation. Men offer themselves, but they don't make her happy. She is like a novitiate searching for the true religion. Ms. Diehl's characters in the early part of the book tend to be props around which the narrator moves, always disillusioned. 
 Ms. Diehl ranges back into Stella's memory, however, and there much of the richness of this book shines through. Stella's description of losing her virginity at 15 in a freezing New Hampshire backyard, after sitting nude in an orgone box, is particularly wonderful. At moments like this, Ms. Diehl achieves a higher plane of vision. It is when we forget the story that the story is at its best - disconnected afternoons with lovers, the view outside a window in San Francisco, a dinner party with a blind psychiatrist and his gorgeous lesbian ex-wife. Margaret Diehl has a poetic gift, and much of the novel is a vehicle for bursts of description. 
 Yet she never describes anyone with the intensity with which she depicts her narrator's thoughts. Stella's unhappiness and joy are central, but the other characters merely fly like moths against the page, never entering the story with any depth. Often Stella's awareness of herself is so high that it acts like a wall, preventing us from deeply believing in anyone else. It is as if their inability to make the narrator happy renders them inaccessible to the imagination. 
 From time to time, however, a few characters in ''Men'' become vivid, like Stella's stargazing grandmother. She is a carefully portrayed woman with shadings to her personality, but, interestingly, she is the most sexless person in the book. In fact, those who do not appeal to Stella sexually are generally the most sympathetic characters. It seems particularly odd that the man with whom Stella finally falls in love remains hazy, someone who is hard to see clearly and who tends to speak in the platitudes of the eternally nice. 
 Nevertheless, Margaret Diehl is a novelist of subtle gifts. She writes about sex without a trace of self-consciousness. She suggests that through sex one can win oneself back, not by the body's ability to satisfy, but by its capacity to cleanse the mind."

"57","Study Tracks Hispanic Community",207609,"|new york|region",18,12,1988,"19881218T000000","|NEW YORK CITY METROPOLITAN AREA|NEW YORK STATE|NEW JERSEY|CONNECTICUT"," 
 As a group, the Hispanic residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are young, poor, underemployed and educationally disadvantaged -and they constitute the fastest-growing segment of the population in the area, a new report says. 
 The report, ''Outlook: The Growing Latino Presence in the Tri-State Region,'' is said to be the first study of the Hispanic population to view the three states as one entity. 
 It was a project of the Latino Commission of Tri-State, the United Way of Tri-State and the Regional Plan Association. It was written to provide data needed by social service and philanthropic organizations, particularly the 1,800 groups supported by the regional United Way to effectively direct programs and money to the needs of Hispanic people. But the study has broad implications for the public sector as well. 
 As Luis Alvarez, chairman of the Latino Commission of Tri-State, said at a recent news conference in the Equitable Center to present the report: ''This was meant for consciousness-raising in the private sector, which must allocate more resources for the Latino community and open its boards of directors to Latinos, and to the government. I would like to see all three governors come together on determining strategy for the critical needs of all the Latinos.'' 
 According to the report, which is based on 1980 census data, including some information that had not been released before, and more recent statistics from state and Federal agencies, the Hispanic population is now growing faster than any other group. Hispanic people are called Latinos in the report, and are broken down into eight subgroups - Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, Colombian, Dominican, Central American, South American and ''other Latinos.'' Substantial Growth Rate 
 ''Between 1980 and 1987, 650,000 Latinos were added to the total Tri-State population,'' the report said. ''Latinos now account for 14 percent of the total - or one in every seven inhabitants. These numbers parallel the Latino community's substantial 30 percent growth rate nationally in that same seven-year period.'' 
 The trend is expected to continue unabated. Nationwide, the Hispanic population is expected to double in 30 years and triple in 60, the report predicts. 
 In the New York metropolitan region, the Hispanic population is expected to double, from 2 million in 1980 to 4.1 million in the year 2000. At the turn of the century, one in every five residents in the three states will be of Hispanic descent, the report says. 
 From 1980 to 1987, the report says, there were 353,000 Hispanic births in the area. Two-thirds of them occurred in New York City, where one of every three births are to Hispanic couples. The national fertility rate among Hispanic women is 23 percent higher than the national average for all women, and among Hispanic teen-agers, it is 34 percent higher. Single mothers are more prevalent in the Hispanic community than elsewhere, the report said. 
 Immigration - both illegal, which cannot be documented, and legal, which can - also contributes heavily to the growth, the report said. 
 By 1987, the one million Hispanic people that entered the country represented 27 percent of all legal immigration since 1980, and a quarter of them said they intended to settle in the New York metropolitan region. The data on immigration do not include emigres from Puerto Rico, who are automatically citizens and who, as the largest subgroup, constitute 54 percent of the Hispanic population in the area. A Diverse Population 
 The study is winning praise from sociologists for the distinctions it draws among Hispanic groups in the area: Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Cubans, Colombians, Central Americans, Mexicans and others. 
 For example, it says Dominicans are expected to provide the largest influx, and Puerto Ricans, now the dominant subgroup in the area, are not expected to be the majority in the year 2000. 
 ''It must always be said that the Hispanic population is very diverse,'' said Robert Bach, a sociology professor and a specialist in immigration and ethnic populations at the State University of New York at Binghamton, who had no connection to the report. ''It is almost incorrect to talk of an entire population.'' 
 But many generalizations are valid, experts agreed. For example, the Hispanic community is predominantly young. ''Two in every five region Latinos are under 20 years of age, while only one in 20 is elderly,'' the report said. 
 The spectre of poverty hangs heavily over this population. In 1980, about half of all working-age Hispanic people in the region had no income from salaries, and an additional 30 percent were paid less than $15,000 a year. The median income for Hispanic families was 55 percent of that for non-Hispanic families. 
 Shirley Rodriguez Remeneski, executive director of Governor Cuomo's Office of Hispanic Affairs, confirmed the report, saying: ''This community is suffering the most. It is the poorest, lives in the worst housing and is economically the worst off.'' Intensified Teaching Efforts 
 Unemployment is severe. In 1987, for example, the report said, ''the Latino community comprised 21 percent of New York City's labor force and 31 percent of its unemployed. The rate of Latino participation in the region's labor force is lower than comparable figures for whites and blacks, while the official Latino unemployment rate is higher.'' Lower participation in the work force among women accounted for much of the difference. The departure of manufacturing industries, traditionally an important source of work for Hispanic people, hit particularly hard. 
 Consequently, intensified efforts to keep children in school and to train adults for service industries are critical. In the region, only one in eight Hispanic people has had any higher education, compared with one-third of non-Hispanics. Half of all Hispanic adults have not completed high school. 
 The sponsors of the report vowed that their work would not be forgotten. A needs assessment study is to follow, as well as similar studies on the Asian community, due early next year, and on the black community, due later next year. 
 Angelo Falcon, president of the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy and a consultant on the project, said: ''By itself, the report cannot accomplish anything. It must be used creatively by the community and by leaders. But it does provide a framework, and I hope it will begin to get policy makers and Latino leaders to frame their issues in a regional context.''"

 Schools spent $3,555 extra for each of the 4.4 million handicapped children receiving some form of special education in the 1985-86 academic year, according to a study prepared for the Government. 
 The total cost for special education students was $6,335 on average, or 2.3 times the $2,780 cost for regular classwork, the report said. About 11 percent of the nation's schoolchildren get some kind of special education. 
 The new $1.8 million study, done by a private research company, Decision Resources Corporation, breaks down the special education costs by the different approaches used to teach children with handicaps that range from physical disabilities to mental disorders. The study examined ''resource programs,'' or those serving pupils for less than half of the regular 30-hour school week, and ''self-contained programs,'' those which occupied more than 15 hours a week. 
 Looking only at what was spent on special education, the resource programs spent $2,463 per pupil versus $5,566 per pupil in the self-contained programs. But the study said the schools also had regular education costs for these pupils - the full regular cost of $2,780 for those in resource programs, and about half as much, $1,347, for those in self-contained programs. That increased the total per pupil costs to $5,243 for those in resource programs and to $6,913 for those in self-contained programs.

 Marcus O'Sullivan will get credit for an indoor world record for the time it took him to run 1,500 meters Friday night even though he was running a mile race. 
 The Irishman was timed in 3 minutes 35.6 seconds en route to winning the mile in 3:51.66 at the Meadowlands Invitational. 
 O'Sullivan's clocking bettered the accepted world record of 3:36.03, set by Jose-Luis Gonzalez of Spain on March 1, 1986, at Oviedo, Spain. 
 Last year, O'Sullivan ran a faster time for 1,500 meters - 3:35.4 - in the mile race at the Meadowlands, but that time wasn't accepted as a record because there were an insufficient number of official timers for the intermediate distance. For record purposes, there must be at least three official watches. 
 In addition, Eamonn Coghlan ran a 3:35.6 and Steve Scott a 3:36.0 at San Diego on Feb. 20, 1981. But neither time was accepted because of insufficient timers. 
 Bob Hersh, records chairman of The Athletics Congress, the national governing body for track and field, said yesterday that because of what occurred in O'Sullivan's case in 1988, ''We were alert to get the record documented this year.''

"63","Real-Life Politics in Deep South",235922,"|u.s.",30,3,1989,"19890330T000000","|UNITED STATES|MISSISSIPPI"," 
 Representative Mike Espy of Mississippi says people have to get used to him. 
 He is a reliable supporter of civil rights, voting rights and sanctions against South Africa, but also backs the death penalty for particularly heinous crimes. He invokes the memory of Fannie Lou Hamer, the Mississippi civil rights leader, but also appears in an advertisement for the National Rifle Associaonon This is real-life politics, bridge-building in the Deep South, the 35-year-old Democrat says. This is representing your district, when your district is half black and half white, receptive to a Democratic economic message but steeped in conservative values, different from that of any other member of the Congressional Black Caucus. 
 There are several firsts and onlys attached to Mr. Espy: the first black Congressman from Mississippi since Reconstruction, the only black Congressman from a rural district, and the Representative of the poorest district in the poorest state in the nation. Some Broader Verities 
 But there are some broader verities here. Mr. Espy says he does not want to sound parochial, but he sings the anthem of the House of Representatives, where life is rarely ideologically neat and where Thomas P. O'Neill's dictum that all politics is local always rules. 
 In 1986, when Mr. Espy first ran in Mississippi's Second Congressional District against Webb Franklin, the Republican incumbent, Mr. Espy won 10 percent of the white vote. In 1988 he won 43 percent. 
 ''Service, service, service,'' Mr. Espy said in explaining his success. He took pains to work with farmers and became a champion of the catfish industry, a major employer there. There was also some very skillful politicking, a formidable organization to turn out the black vote, careful polling that found his areas of strength among whites in his Mississippi Delta district. 
 The Congressman is a serious young man with the earnest likeability of the senior class president that he was. (Back then, there was also a white senior class president at his school.) Mr. Espey, a lawyer, also comes from a notable family; his grandfather built the first black hospital in Mississippi. He knows his own symbolic value. Criticism on N.R.A. Ad 
 With his an image in national political circles, Mr. Espy's decision to appear in an N.R.A. ad this year drew considerable notice and criticism outside his district. (Within the district the reaction was positive.) ''I got some letters from friends in New York,'' the Congressman said. ''They were disappointed. I got some complimentary letters, but most of the letters I got from the East Coast were letters of criticism.'' 
 Mr. Espy notes that he agreed to appear in the advertisement before a gunman armed with a semiautomatic assault rifle killed five children in a schoolyard in Stockton, Calif., in January. The slayings ignited a raging debate over such weapons. Mr. Espy says he does not agree with the rifle association on every issue, and would support a carefully defined ban on semiautomatic weapons. 
 ''That organization, at least in this part of the country, is one that's highly regarded,'' Mr. Espy said of the association. ''I've been a member since 1974.'' He added: ''Look at me in the context of my record. My record is based on 600-some votes from my first term.'' Conservative Issues Stressed 
 He talked one recent afternoon of the importance of issues like gun control and school prayer in the South, of conservative attitudes among blacks and whites alike. It is a lesson that Democrats outside the region need to recognize, he said. 
 ''You've first got to be invited past the door,'' the Congressman asserted. ''And we don't get invited past the door because of these visceral issues - gun control, flag, patriotism. They don't want to hear your ideas on the economy and foreign affairs and on defense because they don't like you.'' 
 Mr. Espy recently gave a short course on his brand of politics, driving in the late afternoon to the town of Flora, Miss. On the way into town he passed a trap and skeet range, and then, on the edge of town, he happened across a woman he wanted a reporter to meet. The woman, who was 87 years old, was walking slowly up the road, leaning heavily on a stick. She had lived in a utility shed in a junk yard until recently; before that, she had lived between two refrigerators. Mr. Espy had gotten her a trailer. 
 ''Do you remember me?'' he asked her. ''How are you getting on?'' The Congressman in the N.R.A. ad was the Congressman asking after the woman.

 The United States will withdraw a small number of Army troops from West Germany as part of Pentagon efforts to cut back military spending, Mr. Cheney said today. 
 He told a gathering at the National Defense University that about 4,000 troops would be withdrawn from West Germany and disbanded. The troops were used to man the Pershing 2 missiles that are being eliminated under the 1987 Soviet-American accord banning medium- and shorter-range missiles; the troops will not be assigned other missions. Mr. Cheney did not set a timetable for the move. 
 While the number of troops withdrawn is not significant in a military sense - there are estimated to be 205,000 American military personnel in West Germany - the move comes at a time when some NATO supporters have expressed anxiety about American withdrawals. 
 The move also reflects a partial change in the Pentagon's position. It has decried Congressional efforts to require the withdrawal of troops from Europe that have been used in support of the Army's Pershing 2 missiles and the Air Force's ground-launched cruise missiles, which are being eliminated under the 1987 accord. 
 Two members of Congress, Representative Andy Ireland, a conservative Republican from Florida, and Patricia Schroeder, a liberal Democrat from Colorado, are sponsoring legislation that would require the withdrawal of all of the troops that have been ''associated'' with the American medium-range missiles being eliminated. 
 The Congressional measure was intended to save money and to prod West Europeans to do more in their own defense."

 McGraw-Hill and John Wiley & Sons have both decided not to participate in the Iran Book Fair next month after widespread criticism of plans by the two publishing houses to have their books displayed there. 
 Writers' groups and other publishing houses praised the two companies today for withdrawing from the fair, but several people in the industry said the decisions were largely symbolic since the books were shipped long ago to the fair, which is to be held May 7 to 19. Now the companies have withdrawn their authorization for the books to be displayed. 
 McGraw-Hill's books were scheduled to be displayed by an Iranian distributor, while Wiley's were to be displayed with those of several European publishers. Neither company had planned to send any personnel to Teheran. Nevertheless, both houses were sharply criticized by American authors and publishers this week for agreeing even to send books. PEN Praises Move 
 Two months ago Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, called for the killing of Salman Rushdie, the author of ''The Satanic Verses,'' which the Ayatollah called blasphemous to Islam. The Ayatollah also threatened Viking Penguin, the publisher. 
 Susan Sontag, president of the PEN American Center, which represents 2,200 writers in the United States, said, ''I am delighted and always hoped and expected that American publishers would stand together to express their solidarity with writers and other publishers being subjected to the monstrous intimidation emanating from Iran.'' 
 McGraw-Hill's decision to withdraw was announced in a statement made public yesterday afternoon. ''The original decision to participate in the book fair,'' it said, ''was based on the belief that 'there should be no sanctions on knowledge,' and that some good would be served by making medical, scientific and technical publications available to Iranian students. However, the unfolding politicalization of the book fair indicates participation serves no constructive purpose.'' Wiley's Position 
 The Wiley statement reiterated the company's position that authors must be free to write and that publishers must be free to distribute their writings ''anywhere and everywhere.'' Thus more than a year ago, it said, Wiley agreed to display some books in Teheran, and it sent them shortly thereafter. 
 Leonard Harris, a Wiley consultant, said yesterday that the company learned two days ago from ''an international publishing source'' that Iran has decided to withhold visas from some publishers and individuals and that it has also excluded the books of some publishers. 
 ''So Wiley notified officials of the Iran Book Fair that we will not participate in the fair,'' he added. 
 American publishers say Iran's book fair, which specializes in scientific, technical and medical books, is modest in comparison with the better-known Cairo International Book Fair held each year."

"70","C.I.A. Chief Wary of Pakistani Nuclear Program",251496,"|world",19,5,1989,"19890519T000000","|PAKISTAN|INDIA"," 
 William H. Webster, the Director of Central Intelligence, told Congress today that Pakistan was ''engaged in developing a nuclear capability'' while its rival India had begun research that could be used to make thermonuclear weapons. 
 Mr. Webster's statements, shortly before a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, appeared to be an effort by the Bush Administration to underscore its concern about Pakistan's nuclear research program. 
 A Senate aide said the questions and answers on the issue had been coordinated with the Central Intelligence Agency before Mr. Webster's appearance before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. It was the first time Mr. Webster had publicly addressed an issue that has long worried American intelligence analysts and foreign policy officials. 
 By law, for Pakistan to continue to receive American aid, the President must certify to Congress annually that Pakistan does not possess a nuclear explosive device. Last November, President Reagan told lawmakers that while Pakistan had not yet built a bomb he was ''extremely troubled'' by the prospect of a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent. 
 Representative Stephen J. Solarz, a Brooklyn Democrat, said Pakistan was informed that if it did not redirect its nuclear program, the President would be unable to make the appropriate certification to Congress this year. Mr. Solarz said he recently heard from a senior American official that the Pakistanis were responding. ''The implication of this testimony,'' he said, ''is that they haven't,'' Mr. Solarz said. 
 India detonated a basic atomic device in 1974, but experts say its pursuit of a more sophisticated thermonuclear weapon, the so-called hydrogen bomb, began only recently. At the same time, Pakistan's development of a nuclear bomb has been the subject of high-level concern in the United States since the 1970's. 
 In his testimony, Mr. Webster also made these points: 
 * Argentina has been selling nuclear technology to Iran, Egypt and Saudi Arabia and has been assisting Iraq in development of the Condor II ballistic missile. 
 * North Korea has begun manufacturing Soviet-designed Scud B ballistic missiles. The 1950's technology was used by Iran and Iraq to devastating effect during the so-called ''war of the cities'' in which the two nations traded missile attacks on their capitals before a cease-fire last year. 
 * China is ''actively promoting'' the export of shorter range ballistic missiles with ''a mix of financial and political objectives'' motivating the sales. 
 Mr. Webster told the Senate committee that India had been seeking to separate and purify an isotope called lithium-6, and he called this an ''indication of interest'' in thermonuclear devices. He added that the missile and atomic research programs of India and Pakistan have ''all the earmarks of a race.'' Problems for the U.S.  ''Clearly Pakistan is engaged in developing a nuclear capability,'' Mr. Webster said. ''What creates problems for the United States is whether that capability has reached a point that it implicates the various amendments that apply to other assistance and relief for Pakistan.'' 
 Pakistan is receiving $576 million in economic and military aid this year from the United States, and the Bush Administration has asked for $621 million in the coming fiscal year. 
 Mr. Webster's remarks on Pakistan brought a sharp rejoinder from Senator John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat who is chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee. Senator Glenn asserted that Pakistan's nuclear activities were already sufficient to prompt a cutoff in aid, but that the United States had overlooked the violations because it had such other interests in Pakistan as support for the Afghan guerrillas. 
 ''We don't seem to be willing to do anything about this,'' the senator said. ''We're not willing to put teeth into it. The law is very clear on what should be done, and yet we always make some excuse and overlook it somehow.''"
"71","U.S. Secretly Helped France Develop Nuclear Weapons, an Expert Writes",254209,"|world",28,5,1989,"19890528T000000","|FRANCE"," 
 In a highly secret arrangement, the United States has long provided substantial covert assistance to the French nuclear weapons program, apparently in violation of American law, an authority on international relations says. 
 Under the arrangement, Washington furnished information to France on how to design and build nuclear weapons and to deliver them by missiles and aircraft. It has been highly beneficial to both countries and since the mid-1970's has encouraged the de facto reintegration of France into North Atlantic Treaty Organization's defense plans, Richard H. Ullman wrote in an article for the summer issue of Foreign Policy magazine. The French withdrew from the NATO defense arrangement in 1966. 
 The agreement to share secret nuclear information with France was instituted more than 15 years ago by President Richard M. Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry A. Kissinger, who was also Secretary of State, and has been endorsed and approved by every President since, Mr. Ullman said. He added that it was followed with special vigor during the Carter Administration. 
 Mr. Ullman, who is the David K. E. Bruce Professor of International Affairs at Princeton University, worked on the policy planning staff in the Defense Department and the National Security Council in the 1960's, and has also been an editorial writer for The New York Times.  Playing '20 Questions' To Inform the French 
 A technique known as ''negative guidance,'' sometimes called ''20 questions,'' was used to circumvent American law forbidding the transfer of restricted nuclear data to France. In many years of what is described as perhaps the best-kept secret in recent Washington history, United States scientists were permitted to listen to French descriptions of that country's research programs and give guidance as to whether the French were on the right track, the article said. 
 Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said today in Rome, where he is traveling with President Bush, that the secret arrangement between the United States and France was ''entirely consistent'' with the laws of both nations. 
 When asked to comment on the Ullman article, a Pentagon spokeman, Lieut. Col. Keith Schneider, confirmed some aspects of it, saying the data exchange was consistent with existing agreements and not illegal. 
 There have been several meetings involving American and French technicians every year since 1972 under the terms of a 1961 agreement on nuclear cooperation, Colonel Schneider said. In 1985, that 1961 agreement was ammended to encompass other forms of cooperation. 
 ''What we are talking about is a 1985 amendment to a 1961 agreement,'' he said. ''The 1961 agreement between the United States and France provides for exchange of classified information on military planning and protection against nuclear weapons affects and the operation of delivery systems. 
 ''France withdrew from NATO's integrated military structure in 1966. Following that, exchanges of unclassified nuclear information were resumed in 1972. They were aimed at improving our mutual understanding of technologies in order to enhance our mutual understanding of nuclear safety and measures to deal with nuclear weapons accidents.'' 
 The United States did not furnish actual designs or pieces of equipment, which would have been a clear violation of the law, but the exchanges of data between scientists had been so unrestrained, one official said, that officials sometimes worried about how much information had been given. 
 The secrecy was much less important to the United States than it was to French politicians, who did not want to violate the Gaullist doctrine of French military independence from the United States and the public illusion that the French nuclear striking force was entirely home grown, Mr. Ullman said.  A Step-Saving Road To Nuclear Weapons 
 The guidance probably saved France great expenditures and effort by steering it away from research paths that the more mature United States nuclear weapons program had already found flawed. Mr. Ullman said it also probably permitted the French to develop independently targetable multiple warheads - the basis of modern nuclear striking power - much sooner than would have been the case othewise. 
 In turn, the article said, French Presidents and generals had agreed to coordinate target plans for their nuclear warheads much more closely with United States plans. But the French did not forego a city-killing target plan that it would use against the Soviet Union in case the United States refuses to use nuclear weapons to forestall an invasion of France. 
 According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, the French now have 96 multiple warhead nuclear missiles on six submarines, and 18 ballistic missiles capable of reaching the Soviet Union in ground silos. They also have 18 long-range Mirage bombers and 38 navy planes that could carry nuclear weapons to some targets. The army has 32 shorter-range surface-to-surface missiles. The French nuclear forces, like those of Britain, were not covered by the 1987 American-Soviet medium-range missile treaty.  Keeping a Secret: 'A 1,000-Piece Puzzle' 
 The French-American cooperation agreement has been of less significance in recent years as the French weapons research program has developed and become less dependent on outside assistance, Mr. Ullman said. 
 Any taint of illegality may have been erased in 1985 when the United States and France negotiated a new executive agreement that permits sharing of restricted nuclear data. Pentagon officials told Mr. Ullman that the agreement was submitted to Congress, but Mr. Ullman said it was not clear that key figures on Capitol Hill had been aware of it or grasped its significance. 
 Mr. Ullman said his article was based on over 100 interviews in two years here and in France with former and present offcials, including many in ''the most sensitive positions.'' All declined to permit the use of their names. 
 An assistant to Mr. Kissinger said he was unable to comment on the article. Some high former officials were unavailable or declined to comment, but several seemed at least slightly shocked at the revelation. ''I can't possibly comment,'' one said. Another said ''this involved several administrations.'' Still another said, ''I knew only a few pieces of a 1,000-piece puzzle.'' The remarks seemed to confirm Mr. Ullman's contention that the secret had been tightly held. The officials did not deny his account. 
 A former Nixon Administration official, asked to comment on the article, said, ''People usually leak things to get them stopped. I don't think anyone thought this program should or would be stopped.'' 
 The decision in 1974 by President Nixon and Mr. Kissinger was a watershed in United States-French relations. Previously Congress and Presidents had believed that a ''third decision-making power'' on the use of nuclear weapons was dangerous. 
 The Nixon team, Mr. Ullman said, decided that the arrangement was beneficial because it would increase uncertainty in the Soviet Union about a calamatious response to military agression. Moreover, he wrote, it appeared that nothing could dissuade the French from achieving independent nuclear status. 
 France had already exploded a fission weapon in 1960 and a fusion weapon in 1968, years before the agreement went into effect. But refinements needed for an effective force apparently did grow out of it, the article said. 
 Mr. Ullman wrote, for instance, that ''The French sought and received advice on miniaturizing their warheads,'' which is necessary for independently targtetable mulitiple warheads, ''and on shielding them from electomagnetic radiation generated by nearby nuclear explosions.'' Information on missile design and how to conduct underground tests was also passed on, he said. The transfer of that kind of data was not prohibited by law. 
 Moreover, the article said, ''the United States has made available intelligence data on Soviet targets and how they are defended,'' which could keep the French deterrent viable.  Extent of Cooperation Was Largely Unknown 
 The fruits of the United States initiative have been many, Mr. Ullman suggested, leading to a diplomatic intimacy not much understood outside the highest American and French circles. 
 He said that military cooperation between the once estranged partners was ''extraordinary'' in part because ''its full extent is unknown not only to the publics and to nearly all the elected politicians of the various countries involved but also to the most senior - let alone junior - civilian political-military bureaucrats in their foreign and defense ministries.'' 
 Mr. Ullman wrote that officials of both countries saw the political significance of the arrangement as even greater than its military value. During the Carter Administration, for example, David Aaron, the deputy national security adviser, regularly traveled to Paris for consultations with French officials on a range of security issues. 
 In early 1981, when the Reagan Administration took office in the United States and Francois Mitterrand took over the French presidency from Valery Giscard d'Estaing, Mr. Ullman wrote, the American Ambassador, Arthur Hartman, assured Mr. Mitterrand that Washington wanted the nuclear relationship to continue. To the French leader, according to the article, this was an important indication that the United States would treat his Socialist Government as it had its conservative predecessors. 
 Neither Mr. Aaron nor Mr. Hartman was available for comment. 
 French Role in NATO: A New Monkey Wrench? 
 According to Mr. Ullman, secret but intense joint military planning has induced France to immediately make available its sea and airports, railroads and pipelines in case of war and to move its forces into central Germany where, according to an American officer, ''they are going to be in the chain of command'' of the Atlantic alliance for practical purposes, despite professed French independence. 
 This is significant because, despite American complaints about Soviet bloc military superiority, the Western alliance with France included has more men under arms than the Warsaw Pact, he said. A good deal of this was already known, but Mr. Ullman provides new detail. 
 In the early 1980's, Mr. Ullman wrote, ''Operational coordination of French tactical air forces and NATO air forces in Central Europe became considerably tighter. Selected French airfields were earmarked and surveyed to serve as potential dispersion bases for NATO's airborne early warning system.'' 
 Despite the advantages that he believes grew out of the agreement, Mr. Ullman wrote that ''it is a narrow question whether American policymakers were justified'' in their decision. ''It seems clear that the U.S.-French nuclear program contravened the spirit of the Atomic Energy Act,'' he said, and suggested elsewhere that the letter of the law had also been violated. 
 Possible drawbacks are that the agreement could complicate Soviet-American arms talks and that West Germany may feel that the United States was never sincere about its professed policies on nuclear proliferation. 
 Mr. Ullman suggested that it was time to make the covert cooperation overt, saying even French politicians sensitive to nationalist sentiments and Gaullist theory had little to lose now by doing so. ---- French Have No Comment PARIS, May 27 - French officials had no comment on Mr. Ullman's article until they had a chance to read it, but they stressed that France remained committed to its position as a member of NATO autonomous of the alliance's integrated command. 
 In recent years, there have been numerous signs of what some diplomats call ''France's de facto integration'' in NATO. 
 American commanders have privately said they have no doubt that France would participate from the first hour in the case of a Warsaw Pact assault on Western Europe. President Mitterrand and other French leaders have made it clear that they would regard any attack on West Germany to be an attack on France. 
 Francois Heisbourg, director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said Mr. Ullman's revelations might not have a big impact in France because ''the French have become a lot more relaxed about these things than they used to be.'' 
 ''If you have an independent nuclear force you can decide to use it in various ways,'' said Mr. Heisbourg, who is French. ''If you're truly independent, you can have a dialogue and you can have contingency planning that covers the whole spectrum of possbilities.''"

 President Bush said today that the changes transforming Eastern Europe are ''absolutely amazing,'' and credited the Soviet Union with making those changes possible. 
 Mr. Bush's buoyant reflections on his five-day trip to Poland and Hungary were a far cry from the tart skepticism he maintained toward President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union and changes in Eastern Europe during his campaign and the opening months of his Administration. 
 ''I am firmly convinced that this wave of freedom, if you will, is the wave of the future,'' President Bush said, as he flew on Air Force One from Budapest to Paris today to attend the economic summit and the celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. ''And I would expect that this visit has been watched by the people of other Eastern European countries and hopefully given encouragement to those who want to go to the path of reform.'' 'Right From the Heart' 
 He said he had been surprised at ''the feeling and emotion of it all,'' and said the meetings were not ''your traditional 'I'll read my cards and you read your cards' kind of diplomacy.'' 
 Communist and opposition leaders ''spoke right from the heart'' to him, he said, and he tried to respond in kind. 
 ''It was very special in that regard,'' he said. ''There's an intensity to it, a fervor, that moved me very much.'' 
 Of his meetings with the Communist leaders in Poland and Hungary, Mr. Bush said: ''I made very clear to them that, you know, we are not there to poke a stick in the eye of Mr. Gorbachev -just the opposite, to encourage the very kind of reforms that he is championing, and more reforms.'' 
 Asked if it was Mr. Gorbachev's approach to East-West relations that has given people in Eastern Europe the license to make changes, Mr. Bush agreed and said he wanted to ''repeat for the umpteenth time'' that he wants to see perestroika succeed. 
 ''I think without the change in the Soviet Union it would have been highly unlikely that Eastern Europe would be achieving the kinds of changes that it is aspiring to,'' he said. Aims to Please Soviet Leader 
 Although some critics felt that Mr. Bush had been too cautious and low-key in his appeals to democracy, as a sop to Mr. Gorbachev, the President made it clear that he wanted the Soviet leader to be pleased with his trip rather than irritated. 
 Mr. Bush, who once insisted it was important not to take a romantic view of the Soviet leader, said today that he intended to have regular meetings with Mr. Gorbachev. 
 He rejected suggestions that the United States was dragging its feet on arms control as ''pure nonsense,'' and said he does not listen when Soviet spokesmen say the Soviets cannot meet the reduction timetables on Mr. Bush's conventional arms proposal. ''I don't think Gorbachev wants to slow down an agreement on conventional arms,'' the President said. ''I think he wants to move forward there and on the strategic arms talks, and so do we.'' 
 The President said he was particularly struck by how emotional his meetings with Hungarian leaders were, and by the warmth of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Polish leader. Mr. Bush said the general ''is really out front in the reforms,'' Reaffirms Policy on Israel 
 The President also reaffirmed the Administration's policy on Israel and the future of the occupied territories. 
 ''We might as well be frank with our friends, because that's what friendship is about,'' he said. ''And so I want to see things go forward in terms of the peace process over there. And we want to see the election process go forward. And if anybody can make a case for me that the recent deliberations in that party will enhance the election process, then I'd say, great,'' the President said. 
 He was referring to the Likud Party's decision last week to attach strict conditions to Prime Minister Yizhak Shamir's plan for elections among Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Some members of the Labor Party and many Palestinians say the conditions would kill the proposal for elections in the occupied territories. 
 ''But I'm afraid other people are looking at it saying what's happened does not enhance the possibilities of election. So the U.S. policy is set, and I'm the President of the United States, and Israel is a friend and will remain a friend, but I have to say what our policy is.'' 
 Asked if he was under pressure about his Israel policy, the President replied: ''They've got great difficulties inside of Israel. I understand that. I understand the political pressures. But I can't be varying U.S. policy every day to accommodate political change. I'm not going to do that.'' 
 Before the Bushes left Budapest, he stopped to place flowers at the Raoul Wallenberg Memorial, dedicated to the Swedish diplomat who helped Jews escape Nazis during the war. Thousands of people lined the route from the memorial to the airport. 
 When the President arrived in Paris, he went to a lunch at which President Francois Mitterrand was the host. He sat between Mr. Mitterrand and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. 
 After lunch the President met privately with President Mitterrand in an ornate gilded room at the palace. 
 General Scowcroft said afterward that the two leaders spent most of their time talking about President Bush's trip to Hungary and to Poland, which Mr. Mitterrand visited recently."
"75","Carreras Eases Back Into Opera, Helped by Spain's Cultural Revival",270226,"|arts",29,7,1989,"19890729T000000","|SPAIN"," 
 After a two-year break forced on him by a painful course of treatment for leukemia, Jose Carreras, the Spanish tenor, chose a little-known provincial arts festival as the occasion to test his strength - and voice - in a full-scale opera. 
 He purposely picked a role -Jason, in Cherubini's ''Medea'' -that he had not sung before, to avoid comparisons with any of his own past performances. And with the stage dominated by the flamboyant figure of Montserrat Caballe as Medea, his was also not an exhausting role. 
 As a strategy, it worked. The Spanish critics said he passed the test without a hitch, the rich tone of his voice seemingly unaffected either by his illness or by the intense heat that still enveloped Merida's open air Roman Theater when the second of the opera's three performances began shortly before midnight on Wednesday. 
 Diagnosed with leukemia in July 1987, the 42-year-old tenor has been preparing for his return to opera for the last year with a gentle program of recitals in Europe and the United States. Now, while determined not to overload himself with commitments, he plans to take on the role of Don Jose in Bizet's ''Carmen'' in Vienna next year. Some Other Attractions 
 Yet it was more than curiosity, sympathy or admiration for Mr. Carreras that prompted several Government Cabinet members, opera fans from Madrid and beyond and a huge crowd of enthusiastic local residents to attend Spain's first performances of ''Medea.'' 
 Thanks in part to Mr. Carreras, but also to Miss Caballe, the tenor Placido Domingo and an array of other top Spanish singers, opera is having an extraordinary boom in Spain, playing a central role in the broad cultural revival that has followed the return of democracy here a decade ago. 
 Under Franco, the Government did not support the arts, Miss Caballe said. ''Now theaters are being renovated, sponsors are available and, certainly in the case of opera, there is new interest.'' 
 Today, world-class singers are drawn not only to the Teatro de la Zarzuela in Madrid and the Teatro del Liceo in Barcelona, but also to regional festivals. Next month, Mr. Carreras, Teresa Berganza, the Spanish mezzo-soprano, and the American bass Samuel Ramey will be singing in recital in Santander, while Luciano Pavarotti will perform in Puccini's ''Boheme'' in Bilbao. The Effect of Publicity 
 For Enrique Franco, the music critic of El Pais, an independent daily, the opera boom here has much to do with what he calls ''the bombardment of publicity and marketing'' that surrounds such stars as Mr. Domingo and Mr. Carreras. 
 ''I'm a bit suspicious because the public responds mainly to the big names and the popular operas,'' he said. ''Without famous singers or famous pieces, there is less interest.'' 
 Mr. Domingo, though, does not apologize for this. ''It's largely our doing,'' he said in a recent interview with El Pais. ''It's been premeditated, at least in my case. We have created a desire to go to the opera because we have become popular by recording popular songs and through publicity.'' 
 Yet Mr. Franco said he also saw a positive side to the opera fashion. ''Young Spanish composers are once again writing operas,'' he said, mentioning Cristobal Halffter, Luis de Palo, Jose Ramon Encinar and Leonardo Balada. ''In a few years, we may well find we have 20 new operas.'' 
 Mr. Encinar's ''Figaro,'' for example, was performed last month in the Teatro de la Zarzuela, while Miss Caballe will sing the main soprano role in the premiere of Mr. Balada's ''Cristobal Colon'' - ''Christopher Columbus'' - in Barcelona in September. A Perfect Setting 
 Jose Monleon, director of Merida's Classical Theater Festival, which for the first time has included an opera, pointed out that Spanish theater directors were also now showing interest in opera, among them Lluis Pasqual and Jose Luis Alonso, who directed ''Medea.'' ''This is a theatrical phenomenon, too,'' he added. 
 The Roman Theater here was a perfect setting for this opera, not only because its acoustics proved to be good but also because its reconstructed columns and steps were an ideal backdrop for the classical theme of ''Medea.'' A cloudless night and even occasional shooting stars only added to the magic. A Slump in Zarzuela 
 Spain's new attraction to opera has led to a slump for the country's traditional light opera, known as the zarzuela. ''Its time has passed,'' Mr. Franco said. ''Even the Teatro de la Zarzuela rarely puts on zarzuelas. But it doesn't mean that it can't make a comeback.'' 
 Such is the aura of stardom surrounding Mr. Domingo, Mr. Carreras and the like, that even such established though older pillars of Spanish music as the soprano Victoria de los Angeles and the tenor Alfredo Kraus, both of whom mainly sing recitals today, have been somewhat forgotten. 
 Rather, the search is on for new superstars. And while none have yet appeared, Miss Berganza and the soprano Pilar Lorenger already have a considerable following, while the young soprano Maria Gallego was hailed for her role as Glauce in ''Medea.'' 
 While there is undoubted pride in the prominence of Spanish singers, however, the thirst for opera echoes beyond simple nationalism. This week, for example, the Russian contralto, Elena Obraztsova, was acclaimed for her performance as Neris in ''Medea.'' 
 But if the renovation of the exquisite Teatro Real de la Opera is completed on schedule for the 1991-1992 season, it requires no special powers of prediction to guess that Madrid will also try to challenge Milan - and La Scala - for the title of opera capital of Europe."

"77","Pros Who Know How to Get Rid of It All",272654,"|new york|region",6,8,1989,"19890806T000000","|CONNECTICUT|FAIRFIELD COUNTY (CONN)"," 
 THE tag sale was not to begin until 10 A.M. but some anxious customers were parked along the road the night before and had slept in their cars. More shoppers arrived at 7:30 A.M. and by 9:45, just before the sale was to open, dozens of people were lined up at the door hoping for the first crack at the advertised set of Mercedes tires, spinet piano and Oriental rug, as well as the hundreds of other items that are traditionally sold at low prices at such sales. Before the sale was over, hundreds of people would pass through the Stamford house on this Saturday. 
 ''It's physically and mentally very taxing,'' said Lynn Westmeyer, whose Stamford company, the Good Riddance Girls, managed the tag sale. Her partner, Debby Berman, added: ''You have to like this kind of thing. You're running up and down the stairs, down to the patio, to the garage, out to the backyard and up the stairs again.'' 
 For people like Ms. Westmeyer and Ms. Berman whose business is to run other people's tag or estate sales, the work actually starts weeks earlier. And tag-sale professionals say that this year they are busier than ever.  More Sellers, More Buyers 
 They report that more and more people are disposing of their household contents through tag sales and that the number of people who shop at these sales is also growing. 
 ''People these days like to buy things at tag sales because you can get a $600 chair for $50,'' Ms. Westmeyer said. 
 Most tag-sale managers are in Fairfield County. Unlike the type of sale in which knickknacks are piled high on folding tables and children's board games, toys and old clothing are scattered on the lawn, professionally run sales are conducted inside the house, and many tag-sale companies will not take a job if they estimate the sale value of the merchandise at under $4,000 or $5,000. 
 Most people in the tag-sale business are licensed appraisers. And all must be licensed through the state tax department in order to operate. 
 People who hire tag-sale professionals are usually moving because of divorce or a new job; often the assignment is to handle the estate of a deceased relative. 
 ''It gets it all over with in a big hurry,'' said Carl DuBois, who hired the Good Riddance Girls to sell the contents of his parents' ranch house in Stamford a few years ago after they died. The sale included two Steinway grand pianos and 11 diamond rings. 
 ''It's like using a real-estate agent instead of selling your own home,'' he said. ''It's really better to use a professional.'' 
 The Good Riddance Girls recently held one of the roughly 50 sales they handle each year. Like other tag-sale professionals, they spend about a month preparing for each one. 
 The process starts with an assessment of the estate to determine whether there is enough merchandise to make it worth their while. They get 25 percent of the gross sales, Ms. Berman said. Next, they take photographs of some of the more impressive items, like boats, antiques and jewelry, and make up flyers to send to people on their mailing list. 
 The Good Riddance Girls then place newspaper advertisements. On the Monday before the sale, they begin the tedious task of marking a price on each item. Since they work on commission, it is advantageous to make everything look as good as possible, which may include polishing furniture and making small repairs. 
 Merchandise is set up in its natural setting. For instance, a quilt would be spread over a bed; a couch would be in its normal position in the living room, and plants would be near a sunny window. 
 On the day of the sale, the homeowners, if still living in the house, leave for the day, and Ms. Westmeyer and Ms. Berman take over with their hired help.  Unbeatable Bargains 
 Their efforts do not go unnoticed. In addition to the lure of tag sales - finding unbeatable bargains - more people are drawn to the sales when items are set up attractively, and it also brings in more money, Ms. Berman said. 
 Jeffrey Denton and Joan Gurasich, the new owners of the Stamford house at which the Good Riddance Girls held the recent tag sale, went to the sale, which was the first they had ever attended. They bought lawn furniture for $500 and some plants. ''Now we're going to go to other sales to look for a boat for the pond,'' Ms. Gurasich said. ''As long as you're willing to come and spend the time and sort through the junk, it's worth it.'' 
 Sorting through the junk is what tag-sale professionals say lures them to the field and keeps them there. Many call their work ''eternal treasure hunts.'' They often find treasures that homeowners did not know about or thought were valueless in the recesses of attics and basements, in closets and under floorboards and even in the garbage. 
 For instance, Ms. Berman said she has found Indian pottery worth $200 to $400 and expensive jewelry and coin collections stuffed in rafters and nooks and crannies in attics. She has also found $100 bills placed between dinner plates, and a Blunderbuss, a hand pistol from the 1700's, which was loaded and assessed at $300. Ms. Berman sells such items at the tag sale.  'Every House Is Different' 
 ''What I like is that every house is different,'' said Irene Marcenaro, who owns the Westport-based Lock, Stock and Barrel Estate Sales and who has found $1,000 worth of gold in a garbage pail that had been discarded as ''old, broken jewelry.'' She has also found expensive art prints and even hand grenades in a basement, for which she had to call in the police to take away. 
 Joneen Connor, who runs Serendipity Tag Sales in Westport, said she loves her work. ''I love digging into people's attics and basements,'' she said, but she added that the scavenger hunt can be messy. 
 ''There's literally a lot of dirty work involved,'' she said. ''You can't be squeamish. In order to find what may be a collectible, you might also find dirt or mice.'' 
 On top of all the hard work, tag-sale professionals say, is the emotional factor. ''You're dealing with people in a very emotional state,'' Ms. Connor said. ''They're giving up things that are hard for them to do. They're starting a new life, going into the unknown.'' 
 Theft is another unpleasant issue tag-sale professionals must deal with. During one sale, the owners of Those Two Girls Tag Sales in Westport, Pat Fay and Carole Maddock, helped a woman carry a white iron bench to her car. Later that day, after reviewing the receipts, they found that the woman never paid for the bench.  Avoiding Theft 
 ''We take precautions,'' Ms. Berman said. ''We have George, who's 6-feet-4, and Phil, who's 6-foot-1. You have to watch the people; you don't know who they are.'' 
 The guards are usually stationed at the doors to make sure all items are paid for before they are taken out. Sometimes, especially during sales in which there is a lot of expensive merchandise, Ms. Berman will hire an off-duty police officer. 
 ''Anti-theft measures are commonly taken during tag sales,'' she said. In addition to security people, they stamp bags and place special ''sold'' tags with the buyer's name on furniture. 
 Ms. Fay and Ms. Maddock, who 23 years ago started their business and the concept of the professionally run tag sale in Connecticut, also conduct sales in places other than homes. They once sold the contents of a Catholic convent in Westport and the contents of a girdle factory in Southport.  Attracting Celebrities 
 Celebrities get involved in tag sales as well, from the selling and buying end. Ms. Fay and Ms. Maddock sold the contents of Sandy Dennis's Westport home a few years ago. The most remarkable thing about the sale, they said, was Ms. Dennis's 67 cats who greeted everyone at the door. Faye Dunaway, Christopher Reeves and Gilda Radner have been some of the shoppers at the Good Riddance Girls sales. 
 But aside from the excitement of celebrities and the treasure hunts, organizing tag sales takes a lot of time, dedication, hard work and know-how, those who run the businesses say. Because of that, many who try fail within months. 
 ''A lot of companies come and go,'' Ms. Connor said, ''because people don't realize how much is involved.''"
"78","POSTINGS: Preservation an Issue; Opponents Fight Hartford Plan",280099,"|real estate",3,9,1989,"19890903T000000","|HARTFORD (CONN)"," 
 A plan by a Canadian land development company for a $320 million project on the site of two historic buildings in Hartford faces an uncertain future as a result of opposition by preservation groups. 
 The Pan Pacific Development Corporation of Vancouver, B.C., wants to build what it calls the Hartford Town Center on a decaying section of Main Street. Plans called for the center to include department stores and two 22-story office towers enclosing a shopping mall. An 1876 building known as the Cheney Block, designed by the architect Henry Hobson Richardson, would be demolished, as would the adjoining Sage-Allen Company building, which dates to 1898. 
 Within a week of announcing the project, however, George Lawtey, the president of Pan Pacific, changed his proposal and said he would preserve at least part of the facade of the six-story Cheney Block. The Connecticut Historical Commission, the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation and other groups have mounted a campaign to keep the two old buildings. And Hartford's City Manager, Alfred A. Gatta, said city agencies would ''ask many questions'' about the project if Pan Pacific filed a preliminary rezoning application, as required by law. Mr. Gatta noted that the issue was further complicated because, while Pan Pacific bought the Sage-Allen building, it only leases the Cheney Block. The city owns the land and building."
"79","PRETORIA HARDENS TACTICS AT RALLIES",280424,"|world",3,9,1989,"19890903T000000","|SOUTH AFRICA, REPUBLIC OF|CAPE TOWN (SOUTH AFRICA)"," 
 The Government today intensified its crackdown on demonstrators protesting apartheid in advance of Parliamentary elections scheduled for Wednesday. 
 The biggest response was unleashed in Cape Town, where hundreds of police using water cannon, purple dye, batons and rubber whips charged hundreds of protesters marching toward Parliament and arrested about 500 people, including more than 50 journalists covering the march. 
 Among those detained was the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. Most of those held were released on their own recognizance by this evening but faced charges. 
 Today's tensions were alleviated by the incongruity of several incidents described later by journalists and other witnesses. 'You Had Better Disperse' 
 During the melee that erupted on Adderly Street in downtown Cape Town, one unidentified youth climbed up on the water cannon spraying dye and tried to turn the nozzle away from the crowd. When the police tried to grab him, he got away. But part of the building housing the provincial headquarters of the governing National Party was dyed purple, witnesses said. 
 The South African Press Association reported that a policeman put his hand over the lens of a video camera and shoved back the operator, only to realize that he belonged to one of the police video teams taping the demonstrators. 
 And in Soweto, the largest black township outside Johannesburg, a police major at the site of the intended rally wistfully asked several clergymen whether everyone would prefer to go home to watch a championship rugby match being broadcast an hour later on television. Rugby is especially popular among white South Africans. 
 This evening, the South African Press Association quoted a police spokesman, Lieut. Col. J. H. Labuschagne, as saying that nearly 1,000 people had been arrested throughout South Africa since Friday night. They included the 500 people arrested in Cape Town today and 300 students at the University of Natal arrested after a demonstration Friday. 
 Heavily armed black soldiers were deployed in Soweto around an open-air stadium in the neighborhood of Jabulani to help the police prevent a rally called by the South African Council of Churches. ''They have conveyed a message that if you don't want blood, you had better disperse,'' said the Rev. Francois Bill, a senior official at the Council of Churches. Protesters Sprayed With Dye 
 The Council has helped organize a Standing for the Truth Campaign to highlight injustices faced by the country's 28 million blacks, who are excluded from voting in the election. 
 The authorities had previously banned the events in Cape Town and Soweto and legal challenges of the decisions were unsuccessful. 
 Violence broke out after more than 1,000 demonstrators moved through downtown Cape Town in two separate marches. Their way was barred by a phalanx of police who ordered them to disperse and then waded into the processions swinging batons and whips. Some police officers also fired tear gas. An unknown number of marchers were reported wounded, with some requiring medical attention. 
 The demonstration marshals, who were identified by their red arm bands, were taken away first. Some of the marchers dropped to their knees and were dragged to police vans. Others tried to run but were knocked down by blasts from a water cannon, which sprayed the demonstrators with purple dye to identify them for arrest. 'We Shall Be Free' 
 Those who later regrouped in St. George's Anglican Cathedral at the head of Adderly Street were told by a Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu that all the moral right was on their side. 
 ''We have committed ourselves to this struggle until it is won,'' the Archbishop was quoted as saying by the South African Press Association. ''We shall be free, all of us together, black and white. 
 According to a police count, 52 journalists, including television crews, photographers and reporters, were detained for about three and a half hours. Restrictions in effect under the current national state of emergency decree require that journalists immediately leave any scene where unrest has broken out or looks likely to do so. 
 The journalists detained in Cape Town included a television crew from the state-run South African Broadcasting Corporation, which has given prominent coverage to official criticism of the civil disobedience campaign but very little to the demonstrations themselves. 
 In Soweto, about a hundred people drifted from the vicinity of the prohibited rally to hold a brief service in a nearby Catholic church. Several dozen white policemen flicking stiff whips called sjamboks surrounded the church and ordered the occupants, who included perhaps a dozen clergymen and nuns, to leave at once. Journalists were also ordered away. 
 This morning, the Citizen, a daily newspaper with close ties to the Government, reported that the police were rounding up the leaders of the Mass Democratic Movement, an alliance of anti-apartheid groupings that has emerged to direct the protests over the last month. The Citizen said 17 of the leaders had been arrested or detained and that 13 others were being hunted."
"80","Hills, in Japan, Stirs a Baby-Bottle Dispute",290686,"|business",14,10,1989,"19891014T000000","|JAPAN"," 
 In her first visit to Japan as the United States special trade representative, Carla A. Hills faced off today against Japan's hard-nosed bureaucrats. They argued about baby bottles. 
 It began this morning when Mrs. Hills, in a speech, complained about the pettiness of Japanese regulations for imported products, which, she said, often block the sale of American consumer goods. 
 Reaching for a vivid example, she told a large audience of reporters that an American-made plastic baby bottle was barred from Japan by the powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry ''because it had measurements in both the metric and English systems.'' The Japanese use only the metric system. 
 ''As a mother of four,'' she continued, ''I can assure you that a hungry child does not care which way its formula is measured.'' 
 No sooner had Mrs. Hills finished speaking than ministry officials began defending themselves. ''There was a concern about a baby bottle, because some people in MITI were afraid that consumers would confuse the measurements,'' an official of the ministry's Americas division said. In time, however, they determined that Japanese consumers were bright enough to tell the difference between milliliters and fluid ounces. 
 No change was made, shot back the economic division of the American Embassy here, which said it had confirmed that the imports were blocked. So officials of the Japanese ministry directed reporters to Meidi-ya, a major supermarket chain here. Sure enough, Meidi-ya stocks a Gerbers baby bottle with both measurement systems etched onto the side. 
 ''We've had them since 1975,'' said a somewhat bewildered store manager. 
 Mrs. Hills is portrayed in the press here as a far tougher negotiator than Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, who came to Japan last month on his first trade mission. Mr. Mosbacher, the Japanese have said, was unprepared for substantive talks, and a senior Commerce Department official said recently, ''The trip was not our most successful.'' 
 Mrs. Hills, in contrast, has dominated the headlines here, described by the newspapers as an ''iron lady'' unlikely to sympathize with Japan's contentions that it needs more time to open the country's markets and unsnarl the distribution system. 
 On the evening news here tonight, the Tokyo Broadcasting System said she went from meeting to meeting ''as if she was President,'' and one Cabinet minister emerged from negotiations complaining that Mrs. Hills set schedules that were too tight. He added that she was far tougher than he had expected."
"81","How to Honor a Bride-to-Be",290855,"|new york|region",15,10,1989,"19891015T000000",NA," 
 THE eldest of my three daughters, a 19-year-old with a cheerful outlook, attended her first bridal shower on a recent Sunday. The round trip to Manchester encompassed four hours. She arrived home tired and slightly disappointed. 
 ''They spent most of the afternoon opening gifts,'' she said. ''Oh, what a beautiful toaster...'' 
 I sympathized with her plight and wondered, at the same time, why women didn't borrow a page from the opposite sex's traditional bachelor dinner. 
 ''You mean have a half-naked guy jump out of a cake?'' she asked with a playful smile. 
 No, I assured her, that wasn't what I meant at all. The toasters and the blenders were fine, but something else was needed to transform a gee-look-what-Aunt-Tillie-gave scenario into a more memorable event. A speaking program. 
 Yes, a testimonial. Ask a few of the people who best know the bride-to-be to say some wonderful things about her. Perhaps one speaker could be serious, another would provide some humorous anecdotes. Those who really didn't know the woman would come away with a new awareness, a new appreciation. 
 ''I've attended several bachelor dinners and many of the classier occasions were, in fact, testimonials: the speeches really brought meaning to the affair.'' 
 My wife, who was seated nearby, agreed with my basic premise - a noteworthy occasion in itself. ''Women really don't get the opportunity to say enough good things about each other,'' she chimed in. ''Men, on the other hand, are always honoring each other with some such award. It seems to me that dedicating a portion of a shower to some well-chosen remarks would be a welcome - and worthwhile - change.'' 
 I decided to seek out opinions from some other women in my life. Jeanne, a recent graduate of Sacred Heart University who plans to be married in January of 1991, favored a speaking program in the form of a roast. 
 ''A roast would be funny,'' she said. ''A mother, a grandmother and a close friend could say some funny things about the bride. Perhaps you could have some form of professional entertainment, such as a comic. 
 ''Truthfully,'' Jeanne added, ''when I don't know the people at the shower, it becomes extremely boring.'' 
 A male dancer? Jeanne shuddered in horror at the prospect. ''I think a lot of people do it to get back at men by degrading them. It really doesn't make sense, and frankly I'm not very comfortable with it,'' she noted. 
 Cheryl, who has attended more bridal showers than she would care to admit, was opposed to injecting a speaking program, but she agreed that the traditional shower needed some revisions. ''When you're young, they're fine. But if you've been to many, they become a bore,'' she said. 
 One viable alternative, she added, was a gathering for couples in which both the prospective bride and bridegroom receive gifts. This might work in some cases, but I can think of a lot of guys who wouldn't sit through an evening of watching people unwrap packages. 
 My next-door neighbor, Bobbi, seemed to be opposed to showers on general principle. ''Basically, it's not my idea of a way to spend an afternoon,'' she explained. ''My kids didn't want them, and I haven't been to many. I guess we're not ceremonial.'' 
 Another neighbor, Mary Ellen, shared my belief that a speaking program was a sensible idea that deserved a trial. ''At least it would add another dimension,'' she stated. 
 Women, you are hereby invited to consider my proposal. Complement the shower of gifts with a shower of praise.

"83","A Moment of Decision At the Kennedy Center",305264,"|arts",30,11,1989,"19891130T000000",NA," 
 The announcement last month by the board of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts that it would not renew the contract of Ralph P. Davidson, the center's chairman and president, underlines the special problems of that gleaming culture palace on the banks of the Potomac. 
 The board's decision not to renew Mr. Davidson's three-year contract when it expires in February 1991 came after months of rumors of trustee dissatisfaction, both with his general style of operation and with his slowness in raising funds for the center's $100 million endowment. 
 An unusual blend of the ceremonial and the commercial, the center is a memorial to former President John F. Kennedy, a major tourist attraction and a national cultural center. Even though it receives virtually no Government funds, the center is expected not only to present the best of the performing arts and serve a cultural constituency around the nation, but also to come up with enough box-office revenue to stay in the black (top ticket prices range from $65 for opera to $31.50 for symphony concerts). Private Contributions Needed 
 In addition, the center faces the task of raising 20 percent of its annual operating budget of $57 million from individual, corporate and foundation contributions. The rest of the money comes from ticket sales, concessions like restaurants, shops and a parking garage, and gifts from individuals. The center receives $5 million a year from the Park Service for maintenance of the building and grounds, but must pay back a bit more than $1 million as its share of the cost of maintaining its theaters, backstage areas and offices. 
 As the board begins its search for a new chairman, some trustees have proposed that the job be split between a president responsible for the artistic programming and a chairman responsible for fund raising and financial stability. 
 James Evans, a former chief executive officer of Union Pacific who heads the search committee, said that proposal was still on the table. ''We are still getting organized and we need to have a consensus view of what we really need,'' he explained in an interview. ''We do have Marta Istomin as artistic director and she certainly understands music and dance programing. But we are looking at a very difficult job. There is no built-in constituency. We don't have large corporations based in Washington and we need to raise 3 million corporate dollars each year just to keep the doors open. It would be ideal if we could find Mr. or Mrs. or Miss Wonderful who possessed all those qualities.'' 
 Suggested names, from near and far, are already being floated, Mr. Evans said. For example, he received a telephone call from a prominent Washington lawyer suggesting Robert Bernstein, who resigned as chairman, president and chief executive officer of Random House earlier this month. ''I told him I would add his name to the list,'' Mr. Evans said. ''We hope to have a preliminary report ready for the April board meeting,'' Difficult Questions 
 For 16 years the center and Roger L. Stevens, its founding chairman, were an inseparable pair. Now, as it looks ahead to its 20th birthday in 1991, the center is facing some hard questions about its place in the cultural scheme of things. Should it continue to try to mount the glittering international festivals and other spectacular attractions of its earlier years? Should it seek to develop a National Theater? Should it concentrate on the encouragement of young artists and the seeking out of new talent? 
 ''For so long the Kennedy Center operated under the aegis of its founding father with his sense of mission, but like a lot of other organizations it has now come into its adulthood,'' said Anne Murphy, director of the American Arts Alliance, an arts advocacy group based in Washington. ''When you move from the founding vision, there is a period when it is necessary to reassess what you really need.'' 
 Mr. Davidson, a former executive of Time Inc., had no professional arts background, but he was seen as someone who could put his corporate contacts to work in behalf of the center. He succeeded Mr. Stevens, a longtime Broadway producer who was the driving force behind the move to build of the cultural center. As chairman, Mr. Stevens not only oversaw the center's theatrical programming but was also a master at courting Congress and attracting corporate dollars. 'Following a Legend' 
 ''In Ralph's defense, you would have to say that following a legend would have been very difficult for anybody,'' said Harry C. McPherson Jr., general counsel for the board and a former trustee. It was Mr. Stevens who brought Mr. Davidson to the attention of the board when its search committee, in Mr. McPherson's words, ''struck out'' after an 18-month search. 
 Mr. Stevens concedes that overseeing as complex an institution as the Kennedy Center is not easy. ''There are problems not readily seen by outsiders,'' said Mr. Stevens, who keeps an office at the center but who has returned to his first love, producing Broadway shows. ''Every artistic decision is a business decision and every business decision an artistic decision. It's a tightrope - to say nothing of having people enjoy what you bring.'' 
 ''And no one realizes the difficulty of raising money for the arts,'' he added, ''but the last thing I wanted was Government money for our productions.'' 
 The center, as part of its mandated role as a national showcase, contributes $3 million to $4 million each year to educational and public service programs. For example, it underwrites the annual American College Festival, a half-price ticket program for students and the elderly, and free children and family programing as well as free holiday music festivals. The Department of Education does contribute almost $1 million toward the center's educational programs. The Fund for New American Plays, supported by the center and American Express, helps regional theaters mount new plays and has awarded $820,500 in grants to 19 theaters since its inception in 1985. Pop Programs Criticized 
 The center, whose six theaters are rarely dark, has been criticized for occasionally programming conventional pop concerts and commercial theatrical hits in the hope of offseting box-office losses of other works. But it is prepared to take a financial risk for certain shows. For example, the center has rescued a production of ''Sarafina!,'' the black South African musical, by agreeing to guarantee the production against loss. The show, which now is to open May 1 at the center, was originally scheduled for the National Theater here, but both the National and the Shubert Organization, which books and manages the National, backed away from such a guarantee. 
 ''It's an impossible situation,'' said Martin Feinstein, general director of the Washington Opera, who served as the center's executive director of performing arts until 1980, importing such major attractions as the La Scala and Bolshoi operas. 
 ''The Congressional mandate calls for the best in ballet, the best in music and the best of all the things that are going on around the country,'' Mr. Feinstein said. ''But you have to go for the commercial ventures in order to make a profit to present the things you should be presenting.'' 
 ''In Ottawa,'' he continued, ''the national cultural center gets very strong support from the Canadian Government. In New York, Lincoln Center gets a good sum of money from the New York State Arts Council as well as from the city. Here nothing is subsidized.'' 
 Six years ago, Mr. Stevens hired the iconoclastic director Peter Sellars to, as Mr. Stevens put it, ''shake up the place a bit.'' He turned over the theatrical programming to Mr. Sellars, with the aim of emphasizing noncommercial, experimental work, collaborating with theaters across the country. But the venture, which produced both raves and grumbles from the critics, met with indifference at the box office and was abandoned after two years. 
 Except for a $1.9 million deficit in 1984, the center has managed to break even. A dozen or more national and regional ballet companies as well as contemporary dance groups are presented each year and the center is rich in musical offerings, from opera and symphonic orchestras to chamber music, recitals and jazz. 
 ''We must look for funding for almost all our dance performances and much of our music programming,'' said Mrs. Istomin. ''In recent years, we have been focusing on young American artists and young companies and brought fewer foreign companies here. But within this past year we've had the Kirov Ballet, the London Festival Ballet, Kabuki from Japan, and the Berlin Opera.'' 
 Aaron Sorkin's play ''A Few Good Men'' had its world premiere here, with President and Mrs. Bush quietly dropping by; August Wilson's ''Piano Lesson'' opened Nov. 13; ''Annie 2'' is scheduled for Dec. 22 and a new musical, ''Shogun,'' is to open in April. ''Sheer Madness,'' a farce, has been playing for two years. 
 The Kennedy Center ''produces'' as well as ''presents,'' and is still collecting on its investment in the original ''Annie.'' This year it is co-producing ''Shogun'' and has put money into ''A Few Good Men'' and ''Annie 2'' as well as a number of other productions. Competition at Home 
 ''We don't consider ourselves as just presenters,'' said Drew Murphy, general manager of theater operations. ''As a national culture center we feel part of our job is to help along young producers, playwrights and composers. Sometimes we can give them a financial boost to get a project on.'' 
 Douglas Wheeler, managing director for the Washington Performing Arts Society, an organization that has been importing artists to the capital for 25 years, sees another challenge on the horizon for the Kennedy Center. He points to the half-dozen new theaters planned for the Washington area, including a 2,000-seat theater in the new International Cultural and Trade Center and a new theater in suburban Fairfax, Va., which is being built by George Mason University. 
 ''There's going to be competition for people's time, attention and resources,'' he said. ''Institutions like the Kennedy Center will have to redefine their constituency and role and look for other opportunities.''"
"84","Disinheritance Law Kindles Passion in Louisiana",305606,"|u.s.",1,12,1989,"19891201T000000","|LOUISIANA"," 
 Under mandate of the Legislature, legal scholars here are polishing a new state law that they detest and believe to be unconstitutional. Their task is to mesh the new law with the complex state civil code. 
 Nevertheless the scholars believe the new law, scheduled to take effect on July 1, 1990, will tear at family ties, add fuel to the fire in family disputes and create the potential of costly intrafamily litigation. 
 The law, which was passed last summer amid an acid debate that has not abated, permits parents to disinherit adult children for no reason. It also for the first time allows disinherited children to contest a will on the ground that the favored beneficiary had undue influence with the parent. 
 The new law's best-known champion is Chalin Perez Sr., the wealthy son of the Leander Perez, known as the dictator of Plaquemines Parish as late as the 1960's, who ran the isolated oil-rich region about 10 miles south of New Orleans like a feudal fiefdom. His son has been engaged in two generations of family feuds over power as well as inheritance. Skilled Lobbyist Enlisted 
 Mr. Perez hired a skilled lobbyist to promote the new law, and both were propelling forces in the Capitol as the bill inched its way through the Legislature with little public attention. 
 ''Greed, prejudice, jealousy, meanness and fear will henceforth have a much freer hand in influencing a parent's testamentary plans,'' said Cynthia Samuel, a Tulane law professor and one who is polishing the law. 
 The new law is a revision of a statute that lies at the heart of Louisiana's Napoleonic Code, the system of civil law in use here since 1825. The code has been under revision for years to modernize it. 
 The original statute stipulated that parents must leave a portion of their wealth to their progeny, one-fourth if there is one child and one-half if there are two or more children. Its proponents argue that this ''forced heirship'' law, along with the state's community property law, made Louisiana the fairest of all the states in the way family wealth was handed down from one generation to the next. 
 Under community property law, which is unchanged, family riches belong equally to husband and wife so that a spouse is free to distribute only one-half of the combined assets to his or her heirs. Proponents Claim Flexibility 
 In defense of the changes, proponents say the new law will give Louisianans more flexibility in how they choose to dispose of their estates. In the revision, the Legislature limited the forced heirship law to apply only to children under the age of 23 and to handicapped adult children. 
 Academicians and other legal experts believe the change has virtually destroyed the forced heirship concept, but feel the revision may not survive an attack on its constitutionality because it has introduced an age distinction. 
 In the meantime, under directive of the Legislature, members of the Louisiana State Law Institute, which includes lawyers, judges and academicians, are polishing the legislation's language. Many people who opposed the change continue to debate it, and some have indicated they will lobby for its repeal. 
 For years disgruntled parents have tried to abolish the law, but none as wealthy and canny as Mr. Perez, who learned the intricacies of Louisiana politics at the knee of his father, a master strategist who helped lead the fight against civil rights in the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's. 
 The bill's sponsor, State Senator Sydney Nelson, whose northern district borders East Texas and includes Shreveport, had tried for a decade to abolish the law. But this year he gained a strong ally in Mr. Perez and changed strategy. Rather than seeking outright abolition, Mr. Nelson proposed changing the law to exclude adult children. 
 Chalin Perez hired a prominent Louisiana lobbyist, E. L. (Bubba) Henry, former Speaker of the State House, who shepherded the bill to its final passage. 'He Knew How to Go After It' 
 ''Chalin is very bright and capable and when he wanted to get something done, he knew how to go after it,'' said State Representative Jim Donelon, a suburban lawyer who opposed the bill. Lobbyists ''like Bubba Henry,'' Mr. Donelon said, are usually employed ''by major corporations, by well-heeled types and not by mom-and-pop types.'' 
 Mr. Donelon said others favoring the bill included ''three dozen testators, each involved in some down-and-dirty family fight.'' Advocates also included The Shreveport Times, but the bill was barely noticed by many other newspapers until after it was enacted. 
 Mr. Donelon said he fought the bill because ''we have a system that has worked well for hundreds of years.'' He added, ''I am a card-carrying Republican who respects private property, but I'm also aware of the effectiveness of forced heirship in keeping litigation down as opposed to the other 49 states, which do not have this ancient law.'' 
 Professor Samuel of Tulane and other law professors who fought the change, testifying before legislative committees, say much of the world outside the United States has kept similar forced heirship laws. 
 ''This is an old legal institution that serves a new social purpose, guaranteeing that kids don't get divorced from their inheritance when their parents get divorced from each other,'' she said. ''Sometimes what's old has the wisdom of the ages.'' New Role Seen for Old Law 
 By the early 1900's, Louisiana's forced heirship law had become ''a little old-fashioned,'' said Mary Ann Glendon, a professor at Harvard Law School, but now ''with about 50 percent of all marriages ending in divorce, it has become modern again because of the changed circumstances.'' 
 Professor Glendon said that when a spouse remarries in other states, the children of the first marriage ''are apt not to see property that was accumulated during that marriage,'' adding, ''Louisiana enabled an older person to say to the second spouse 'the law requires me to leave a portion of my estate to my children.' '' 
 At a recent forum on the new law, Frederick Swaim, a professor at Loyola University's Law School here, said, ''We're going to have this thing litigated for centuries.'' 
 Another believer in the old law, Janice Barry, who left her job as staff lawyer in the State Attorney General's Office to raise a family, worked as an unpaid lobbyist against the bill. Mrs. Barry says she is prepared to lobby again for its repeal. 
 She recalled a brisk exchange with a legislator, who told her, ''This is my money, I made it and I can do what I want with it. 
 ''I told him,'' Mrs. Barry said, '' 'They're your children and you made them too and they have a claim.' ''  THE LAW"
"85","Review/Film; Spoofing the Unity of Art and Agony",307375,"|movies|arts",8,12,1989,"19891208T000000",NA," 
 ''Dear Samuel Beckett,'' a wild-haired, whiny-voiced, starving young dramatist writes to his idol. In view of the ''uncanny kinship'' between ''Waiting for Godot'' and ''Despair,'' the young man's own play about life and death (''Life, life, life, death, death, death,'' chants a black-robed chorus), perhaps the two men might collaborate on a future project? He signs off: ''Hoping your next play is a hit. Sincerely, Ira Ellis.'' 
 Ira is the persona adopted by Todd Solondz, the 30-year-old writer, director and star of ''Fear, Anxiety and Depression,'' an amiable, uninspired spoof of the notion that agony and art go together. Nothing that follows is quite as fresh as this opening notion of the stern, reclusive Beckett hooked up with the eager-to-please and quick-to-suffer Ira, the latest addition to the lengthening list of characters inspired by Woody Allen. (Why else would Mr. Solondz ape Mr. Allen's black-rimmed glasses, rumpled plaid shirts and stammering delivery?) Instead, Mr. Solondz's first film goes on to parody the pretensions of the East Village art world, an easy target whose time has passed. 
 Mr. Solondz, who just a couple of years ago was a student at the New York University Film School, uses his film's episodic structure to good advantage. As Ira drifts through encounters with his best friend and with assorted girlfriends manque, Mr. Solondz keeps his eye on loopy, revealing details. His friend Jack is a handsome, pretentious artist who uses white paint to write ''This is not white'' on a canvas, then calls Ira derivative. Ira's sometime girlfriend is Sharon, a chubby mass of insecurities with a lime-green cape and a Snoopy on her handbag; they seem made for each other and dance through a romantic montage in which they gaze over a bridge into heavy traffic and sit in the rubble of an abandoned building. But Sharon (played with comic flair by Jill Wisoff) can discover her great gifts as a mime only after Ira leaves her for Junk, a performance artist who wears blue, green or yellow lipstick and whose art involves hammering nails into a corpse at the Palladium. 
 Each of the set pieces is clever without being strikingly sharp or original. Mr. Solondz slyly acknowledges his debts to other film makers; Junk works in a copy shop, like the heroine of ''Smithereens,'' Susan Seidelman's own first film about down-and-out downtown. And Sharon's plaintive love song to ''I, I, I'' (her pet name for Ira) echoes ''Suddenly Seymour'' from ''Little Shop of Horrors.'' But that wry self-awareness is no substitute for the distinctive voice or vision that Mr. Solondz does not yet have. ''Fear, Anxiety and Depression,'' which opens today at the Quad Cinema, is the work of a gifted and still glib film maker.  WAITING FOR BECKETT - FEAR, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, directed and written by Todd Solondz; edited by Peter Austin, Emily Paine and Barry Rubinow; director of photography, Stefan Czapsky; production designer, Marek Dobrowolski; produced by Stanley J.

"86","U.N.'s Secretary General Agrees To Accept Invitation to Albania",318192,"|world",19,1,1990,"19900119T000000","|ALBANIA"," 
 The United Nations Secretary General has agreed in principle to visit Albania, the last bastion of Stalinism in Europe and a nation accused of serious human rights abuses, diplomats and United Nations officials said today. 
 The Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, was invited by Foreign Minister Reis Malile of Albania when he visited the General Assembly in October. It was the first time Albania had invited the top United Nations official to make an official visit. The invitation will make Mr. Perez de Cuellar one of the most senior foreign visitors that Albania has received in recent years. 
 Albania's United Nations Representative, Bashkim Petarka, confirmed the invitation and the Secretary General's acceptance, saying the invitation represents the ''high esteem'' in which the Albanian Government holds Mr. Perez de Cuellar and its desire ''to cooperate very closely with all the work of the United Nations.'' 
 While a precise date has not been fixed, the most likely time for the visit would be in May, when the Secretary General is expected to travel to Czechoslovakia and Hungary, United Nations officials said. 
 Democratization Rejected 
 Albanian issued its invitation to the Secretary General before it publicly rejected the democratic changes sweeping the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe earlier this month and said it would remain faithful to its own brand of repressive Marxism. 
 The invitation also came before recent reports that the authorities have brutally suppressed riots and demonstrations inspired by the political changes in Eastern Europe. 
 In a New Year's address, the Albanian leader, Ramiz Alia, said the popular uprisings that have ended Communist Party control over much of Eastern Europe would not affect his country because the Government's strict Marxist line hads served it well. ''Therefore, just like yesterday and today, in the future, too, we shall pursue it loyally,'' he said. 
 When Albania celebrated its National Day on Jan. 11, the Communist Party's daily paper, Zeri i Popullit, accused Albanian exiles of fermenting discontent in the country and said they were trying to restore the monarchy. 
 The paper dismissed what it called ''the prescriptions of the capitalist road, of perestroika and bourgeois reformism,'' calling them ''unacceptable to our people and party.'' 
 Disturbances Reported 
 Earlier this month, Yugoslavian newspapers reported that a state of emergency had been declared in the northern town of Scutari after popular demonstrations there and that security was being stepped up around the homes of Albanian leaders in Tirana, the capital. 
 An Albanian border guard who escaped to Greece last week reported that the army and the police had fired on the demonstrators in Scutari and that disturbances had also occurred at Koritsa and Sarande. 
 Albania is under investigation by the United Nations Human Rights Commission. Human rights lawyers say further changes may be brought against the Government this year as a result of the recent disturbances. 
 Western diplomats believe Albania's decision to invite the Secretary General marks a further extension of the very gradual opening toward the outside world that has been under way in Europe's most isolated country since the death of its hard-line leader, Enver Hoxha, in 1985. 
 Some New Commercial Links 
 After having virtually no contact with the rest of the world for years, Albania has begun to develop limited commercial links with Austria, Italy, West Germany and Britain. 
 Last January it played host to a meeting of deputy foreign ministers of Balkan nations. Later this year the foreign ministers of these same Balkan nations - Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Rumania - will meet in Tirana. 
 When he addressed the General Assembly last October, Foreign Minister Malile stressed the country's commitment to what he called ''the process of Balkan cooperation,'' saying Albania now wants closer ties with its neighbors. But he devoted much of his speech to attacking Yugoslavia for persecuting ethnic Albanians. 
 Albania has also invited the heads of several specialized United Nations agencies to visit the country in recent years, including Dr. Nafis Sadik, who directs the United Nations family planning agency, and Edouard Saouma, Director General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.

"87","Baby's First-Year Costs Won't Approach $5,774",321691,"|opinion",30,1,1990,"19900130T000000",NA," 
 To the Editor: 
 I hope no readers really believe the American Demographics magazine estimate of $5,774 for baby's first year's costs (Week in Review, Dec. 31). As a college teacher and mother of five children born between 1962 and 1981, I have to say, ''Ridiculous!'' 
 Such costs might be incurred by double-income couples with no other children, no friends or family. If you have friends with children, you know babies don't need $233 worth of bedding and $995 worth of furniture. You borrow, you shop for used furniture or empty a few of your own drawers, you hem up a few sheets - you've got baby supplies. 
 The greatest expenses - day care ($2,184) and paper diapers ($570) -should be linked to the cost of both parents' working. Day care centers require paper diapers; day care centers also expose the baby to lots of germs (add here the $396 in medical bills). If you take care of the baby yourself, you save - right off the top - a fast $3,000 to $3,150 (allowing a little for shots and checkups). 
 And, if the mother decides to breast-feed the baby, she can chalk up another $855 saved because many experts agree that breast milk alone suffices the first year. 
 And toys? Why spend $199 on toys when babies can't tell the difference between the box the toy came in and the toy itself? Babies play with spoons, cloths, pans - things parents already have. Now we've cut $4,054 from the list. 
 Babies aren't expensive: ignorance is; trying to have it all is. The American Demographics magazine's list applies only to misinformed parents who decorate their babies with expensive items before leaving them in the care of strangers. For such parents, the baby-expense list might include the cost of therapy and special schools their usually less hardy offspring will need after a few years as a status symbol.

"92","Perrier Says Employees Failed to Change Filters",326864,"|business",15,2,1990,"19900215T000000",NA," 
 The contamination of Perrier sparkling water was caused when company employees failed to replace charcoal filters that screen out benzene, a chemical impurity in the natural gas present in the company's famous spring in southern France, Perrier officials said yesterday. 
 At a news conference in Paris, Frederik Zimmer, chief executive of Source Perrier, said the chemical impurities within the natural gas at the company's spring in Vergeze were usually filtered out before the popular beverage was bottled. But because plant workers there failed to replace filters as scheduled, minute quantities of benzene entered the production process, Mr. Zimmer said. 
 The company had previously said that a worker had mistakenly used a cleaning agent containing benzene to clean some production equipment. 
 Benzene, a highly toxic chemical, is a well-known industrial solvent that is made commercially from petroleum. But the chemical also occurs naturally both in drinking and subsurface waters at concentrations up to 10 parts per million. The chemical is a colorless liquid with a distinctive odor. 
 Underground water travels upward through a series of geological strata, including layers of marl, a mixture of sand, clay and limestone. 
 Natural carbon dioxide gas also rises from separate pockets below the water. That gas enters the spring and is drawn off and used to carbonate the beverage as it is bottled, said Jane Lazgin, a spokeswoman for the Perrier Group of America, which distributes the beverage in the United States. The gas is cleaned by passing through charcoal filters intended to remove impurities. 
 Ms. Lazgin said she did not know how often filters were replaced. Tests run in the United States indicated that the beverage had been contaminated with benzene for about six months. 
 The popular drink derives its name from Dr. Louis Perrier, a French physician and entrepreneur. It was Dr. Perrier and St. John Harmsworth, an English aristocrat, who joined in 1903 to help make the spring a thriving commercial enterprise."

 Bishop Is Winner of Seventh Stage 
 In a bravado performance, Andy Bishop of Tucson, Ariz., rode far in front for the last 70 miles yesterday and won the seventh stage of the Tour de Trump race. The 11-day race will end Sunday in Boston. For the fourth consecutive day, Vycheslav Bobrik, a 19-year-old Soviet amateur, was the overall leader. He remained 2 minutes 43 seconds ahead of Raul Alcala of Mexico and PDM, and 2:59 ahead of Steve Bauer of Fenwick, Ontario, and 7-Eleven. The day's race covered 141.8 miles from Winchester, Va., to Harrisburg, Pa. A stiff tailwind helped Bishop cover the final 200 kilometers (124.8 miles) in 5 hours 2 minutes 27 seconds. The 24-year-old Bishop rides for the Spago team, sponsored by Wolfgang Puck, a Los Angeles restaurateur. He finished 3:39 ahead of Philippe Casado of France and the Z/Kickers team. Third place went to Nate Reiss, an amateur from Boulder, Colo., and the Subaru-Montgomery team.

 Chang Loses His Opening Match 
 Michael Chang, who is preparing to defend his French Open title in three weeks, lost his opening match for the second time in two weeks yesterday when he was eliminated from the German Open in Hamburg, West Germany. Juan Aguilera of Spain scored a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Chang, who was playing in only his sixth match since recovering from a hip injury. The match lasted 80 minutes. ''Aguilera played well and I missed a few shots, and on clay sometimes that's all it takes,'' said Chang, who lost to Petr Korda of Czechoslovakia in the opening round of the BMW Open in Munich, West Germany, last week.

"96","Beaufort, a Town That Rose Again",352859,"|travel",13,5,1990,"19900513T000000","|BEAUFORT (SC)"," 
 In March 1936 the photographer Walker Evans, who was documenting poverty in the South, found himself in Beaufort, S.C., facing an undeniably beautiful 18th-century frame house. The delicate carving around the door frame, the detailed corner moldings and elaborate cornices recalled an era of high style and craftsmanship. 
 But this day, its columned, two-story portico was worn bare of paint and patched with handmade signs advertising the businesses inside. 
 There was an art school, a fish market, a fruit and vegetable stand and a stenographer. Some faded lettering suggested former tenants. A sign declared, ''General Lafayette spoke from this porch 1824'' (actually, he spoke in 1825). Below it hung a bundle of spotted bananas. 
 The picture Evans took in Beaufort that day, which is in the Library of Congress collections, showed a little town making do in a setting where the once-bright life of the Old South seemed all but snuffed out. Beaufort's past, tattered though it appeared, looked more substantial than its future. 
 Today the biggest sign on that house proclaims its name - the John Mark Verdier House - and its listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The paint doesn't dare peel. The commercial life has spread up and down Bay Street and along a half-dozen lateral streets. Colorful awnings shade the sidewalk, and wooden barrels planted with pansies, ivy and impatiens stand along the curbs. 
 Prosperity has come to Beaufort and has liberated it from just making do. Gone is the store that sold cigarettes for a nickel apiece; unheard of the old way of repainting the house - one side every couple of years. The ingenious economies of the cash-poor town have all but disappeared. They are not to be found in the groomed yards of the historic district, in the glossy bed-and-breakfast lodgings, in the modish boutiques or restaurants on the river. 
 But if prosperity has forced these habits out of service it has also memorialized them. Today Beaufort's ''poor but proud'' years, which lasted here and all over the South from Reconstruction to the end of World War II, have a place in its history, just as the antebellum years have theirs. Poverty, it turns out, was just another phase in the history of this small town. 
 Beaufort has been a small town for a long time. Spanish explorers came to the area 100 years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock. French, Scottish and English settlers followed, and by the time of the Revolution, Beaufort was a center of the scattered plantation world where slaves harvested rice, indigo and corn. By century's end, the newly invented cotton gin, the successful cultivation of long-staple cotton on the sea islands, and a growing slave population, contrived to launch Beaufort into its heyday - a 60-year spree of building, buying, expanding and high living that ran until about lunchtime on Nov. 7, 1861, when Union soldiers demolished the Confederate port defenses. 
 It is the legacy of these years, the architectural accomplishments they produced and the disastrous decline they precipitated, that impresses every visitor to Beaufort. As in Charleston, the buildings, the old houses and churches stand as they did, now restored, lived in, once again playing a central role in community life. And as common as morning dew is the small-town Southerner's pride in and preoccupation with history, with explaining Southern ways. In Beaufort, there's a story for every piazza - and probably someone nearby to tell it. The past not only informs the present, it seems to populate it. 
 If you want a thoughtful introduction to Beaufort's history, or to examine the roots of its style, the Historic Beaufort Foundation operates two house museums: the John Mark Verdier House (801 Bay Street) and the George Parsons Elliott House (1001 Bay Street). The Verdier House - the house Walker Evans photographed - was fully restored in 1976, to represent the apogee of Beaufort style. The Elliott House (circa 1844) is partially restored. The Arsenal Museum (713 Craven Street) housed in the pre-Civil War Gothic-style military building, offers an informal, eclectic view of life in old Beaufort by means of household objects, clothing, documents, natural history specimens and prehistoric Indian artifacts. 
 Downtown Beaufort is snugly clustered along the river, now a section of the Intracoastal Waterway, and it appears from a distance much as it did when plantation bateaux, cotton barges and steam-driven packets berthed at its wharves. A few miles distant the river enters Port Royal Sound, considered by navigators since the days of Christopher Columbus to be one of the most accommodating harbors on the southern coast. From the Bay Street bluff to the Atlantic Ocean lie hundreds of acres of unpolluted marsh and tidal estuaries, habitats for dozens of species of birds, fish and shellfish. 
 This proximity to the water, or as they say in Beaufort, to the ''weather,'' gave rise to a predominant style of architecture that had its roots in the plantation houses of Barbados. Many houses are set high on foundations made of brick or tabby, a mixture of sand, oyster shells and lime prepared by slaves. Some of these raised basements are arcaded, like the upstairs piazzas, to capture the prevailing southwest breeze. The effect is like a kite held aloft, suspended above the ever-present ballast of humid Lowcountry air. 
 The densest concentration of Federal, Georgian and Greek Revival period houses is to be found on The Point, Beaufort's old neighborhood to the east of Carteret Street. Here stand about five dozen historic houses of exceptional architectural quality, most of them built with cotton profits, many of them accompanied by elaborately landscaped, if not formal, gardens. 
 Bay Street, laid out in the early years of the 18th century, runs west along the river. Its houses, including an unusual one (1211 Bay Street), which combines the native skill of tabby building with a graceful, restrained Palladian portico, form an elegant front line behind which fall narrow streets lined with lovely smaller houses and churches. The graceful interior columns of St. Helena's Episcopal Church suggest the relative simplicity of Colonial-era architecture in a town where embellishment is more common. Its shady, walled cemetery, abundantly landscaped with indigenous plants and full of mockingbirds, is a good place to rest. 
 An impressionistic history lesson can be obtained by making all of downtown Beaufort your classroom. Maps are available for free at the Chamber of Commerce (1006 Bay Street), where children and adults may rent bicycles ($4 an hour, $15 a day) or pick up a recorded cassette tour ($6). Horse-drawn carriage tours start here on the hour seven times a day from 10 to 4 ($7 for adults, $4 for children). 
 At a time when the sheer scale of city life produces fatigue, Beaufort's small size is a relief. A visitor can fold into its routine and take up casual citizenship without doing much more than exploring the downtown historic district, resting on a porch swing, casting a shrimp net, hunting for fossilized shark's teeth, or eating outdoors as the sun sets. Subtle pleasures can be found in simply observing the comings and goings of small town life. Visitors to Beaufort this summer may even see Barbra Streisand or Nick Nolte, who will be there filming ''The Prince of Tides,'' a movie based on the best-selling novel by the Beaufort native Pat Conroy. 
 Local people usually spend their free time on the water. Hunting Island State Park, with three miles of beach and a 115-year-old lighthouse with stairs to the top, is about 30 minutes away by car. Families of deer forage in full view in its maritime forest and clapper rails, herons and raccoons feed all day in the marsh. More than 125 bird species have been sighted here. In nearby Port Royal, a brand-new town boardwalk spans the marsh at the confluence of the Beaufort River and Battery Creek. Shark's teeth lie scattered, half-buried on the sandy shore. From a high platform aerie huge container ships can be seen coming and going at the commercial port. 
 The tides still influence life in Beaufort, though few livelihoods depend on them anymore. Get to know them and you will come to recognize the change of smell in the air, the shifting of the breeze, the movement of shore birds and the best hours for fishing. Times of highs and lows for a week, measured at several locations, are listed daily in The Beaufort Gazette, which appears in curbside newspaper boxes at about 2 P.M. 
 To talk over fishing strategies and to purchase basic tackle, step into Fordham Hardware (701 Bay Street). A bell jingles as you enter. The worn-smooth stone floor, the display windows and shelves stuffed and strung with merchandise, the bins of seed and nails, and the sweet, musty smell endow Fordham's with the authenticity of outdoor labor that slick gardening catalogues crave. 
 Three-quarters of the way back, by the counter, are dip nets, cotton line and weights for catching fish and crabs. A good setup costs about $6. Monofilament shrimp nets, four-and-a-half-feet in diameter, a good size for beginners, cost $36. Beaufort Hardware (723 Bay Street), run, like Fordham's, by a local family for a couple of generations, sells fishing gear at comparable prices. Nonfishermen might enjoy a radio-controlled wooden sailboat or airplane. The recommended bait for crab is chicken necks, the older and more pungent the better; shrimp you encircle by stealth. 
 If you are traveling with children, at least one of them will encrust a sneaker with sandy, souffle-like ''pluff'' mud from the creek. Lipsitz department store (825 Bay Street), another small-town emporium whose type has all but disappeared, can help. Members of the Lipsitz family will sell your family footwear, jeans and sweats while a chatty pet mynah bird diverts the younger set. 
 Across Bay Street is the Waterfront Park, whose playground, landscaped green and harbor promenade are well-suited for games of catch or tag, or just walking. Cruise ships dock on scheduled stops, shrimp trawlers and sailboats tie up periodically and tugboats accompanying loaded barges follow a slow, steady course. Near the playground is an informative photo display depicting rural folk art and traditions. 
 Hours of the day elicit their own pictures in Beaufort. In the early morning, they are noiseless and unpeopled. One might frame the massive stone pillars, mottled with age, at 411 Craven Street; another, the broad arc of oak branches on a tree in the yard of 1 Laurens Street, the house featured in ''The Big Chill'' and ''The Great Santini.'' At first dark of a spring evening, lamplight makes eyes of windows in houses on King Street. The fading light of sunset on the Bay Street bluff silhouettes the painted balustrades, railings and shutters of the houses facing south. When you return to your lodgings or walk to dinner, you will carry with you the scent of Confederate jasmine, still lingering in the warm air. 
 The world of sea island plantations whose slaves helped create Beaufort's antebellum wealth, and the vast geography of water in which Beaufort is just a dot, can best be seen a short distance from town in the direction of the beaches or Port Royal. 
 In the 1890's the historian Henry Adams would board a little steamer packet to ride to a house on the beach where, with a party of Washington friends, he would roast oysters, paint in watercolor and catch crabs. Today Highway 21 will carry you to Hunting Island State Park. If beachcombing and sunbathing aren't enough, the lighthouse can be climbed or bikes ridden on roads that weave through the maritime forest. At high tide the beach disappears due to severe erosion. Or walk the length of Paradise Pier - 1120 feet - which reaches into Fripp inlet at the south end of the island. 
 Or your way you may want to stop for lunch at the Shrimp Shack, a small, rustic restaurant on the side of the road, across from the owner's excellent dockside fish market. Or if the tide is low and coming in, cast a net from Cowan Creek bridge, or in the big bend at Village Creek, two popular fishing spots. Or visit Penn Center on St. Helena Island. 
 Penn was established in 1862 as a school for the newly-freed slaves by two female abolitionists and has remained a proud center of community life ever since. The York W. Bailey Museum (open Monday to Friday, 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.) displays artifacts from Penn's educational mission, past and present, and objects confirming the close ties between African and slave life, which has produced a culture called Gullah. Community singing sessions, open to the public, feature a program of spirituals and readings. They take place at 7:30 P.M. every third Sunday from September to May. 
 The crescent beach off Sixth Street in Port Royal, locally referred to as The Sands, and its adjacent marsh boardwalk, are about seven miles from Beaufort. The boardwalk and 45-foot-high viewing tower offer a panoramic view of the harbor, of Parris Island, the Marine Corps Recruit Training Depot, and of freighters like the Repap, which carries raw materials for glossy paper coating to Canada, and returns with the paper. 
 As Beaufort has become more prosperous it seems able, for the first time, to praise its small town roots as much as its Old South status. The Lowcountry Ledger, a new, thoughtful and determinedly local weekly newspaper, runs a column called ''Old Times Are Not Forgotten.'' It is a compilation of old newspaper items that chronicle church picnics, socials, the pranks of local boys and 100-year-old business gossip. It is a charming celebration of small town life. It never mentions the Old Families or the Old South. 
 The editor says it is the most popular feature in the paper.

 Where to Stay 
 Beaufort's recent prosperity has brought a variety of lodgings to the area. 
 The proprietors of the Rhett House Inn (1009 Craven Street; 524-9030) who used to be in the New York fashion business, have converted an antebellum house a block back from the river into an eight-room bed and breakfast with a look that wears well in the hot weather.

 Places to Eat 
 Nearly every menu in Beaufort includes locally caught seafood. Following are some of the more popular places: The Gadsby Tavern (525-1800) and Plum's (525-1946) open out onto the Waterfront Park and are loose, informal places, especially at lunch. Gadsby's often features live acoustic music Friday and Saturday night. Lunch prices are about $4 to $6 for entrees or a good soup-and-salad combination. At Plum's there are hefty sandwiches (from about $2.50 to $5) and homemade ice cream starting at $1.30. 
 For dinner, The Steamer on Highway 21 on Ladies Island (524-1755) is the most popular place in town, with consistently good seafood dishes and oysters by the bucket. It's noisy and service can be slow. Entrees from about $10, depending on the specials. 
 Wilkop's Whitehall Inn (524-0382) also just off Highway 21 on Ladies Island and The Anchorage at 1103 Bay Street (524-9392) are more formal.

The Shrimp Shack (838-2962) on St. Helena Island or the Dockside (524-7433) in Port Royal offer abundant platters of seafood, slaw and hush puppies. The Dockside is right on the water and offers one of the prettiest sunset views around. Entrees are from $8.50; from about $5 at the Shrimp Shack."
"97","More Eligible for AIDS Drug",357901,"|u.s.",1,6,1990,"19900601T000000",NA," 
 The Government announced today that it had approved a plan to distribute an experimental AIDS drug more widely to patients who fail to benefit from two other drugs now available. 
 The drug, dideoxycytidine, or DDC, fights the AIDS virus. The drug's manufacturer, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. of Nutley, N.J., said up to 1,000 people could be eligible to receive it. But the eligibility requirements are strict, and Kevin Armington, medical information officer at the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York, said: ''I would be very surprised if more than a few hundred people are eligible for this. It is mostly a public relations gesture on the part of the company.'' 
 The company said it would release the drug, in a program called ''expanded access,'' to eligible patients in five or six months if tests on small groups of people go well. DDC is the third drug that fights the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration or to be extensively tested. The others are AZT, the only drug now licensed, and dideoxyinosine, or DDI, which is being used in clinical trials and in an expanded access program for about 9,000 people. 
 All the drugs interfere with the virus's ability to multiply itself. 
 The company is already studying DDC to compare its effectiveness and toxicity to that of AZT. But that study will not be completed this year. So the company said today that it is willing to release some of the drug to those who have no alternate treatments. 
 Three Requirements to Meet 
 Karen Kmetik, a spokeswoman for Hoffmann-La Roche, said those patients must meet at least three requirements. First, they must be unresponsive to AZT or suffer side effects to AZT so strong they cannot take the drug; second, after failing on AZT, the patients must be unresponsive to DDI or have severe side effects to it, and third, they must not have the most common side effect from DDI, extreme pain in the feet or limbs, which is also associated with DDC. 
 Advocates have pressed Hoffmann-La Roche to release the drug to a wider group, and have said that while the announcement today was good news for a few, there are many others who could use the drug. Mr. Armington said those who have not benefitted from AZT should be eligible whether or not they have also failed on DDI. 
 The company will begin with the expanded access program on June 25, when it will begin enrolling 50 people. After 25 of those enrolled have been on the drug for four weeks without any major new side effects, the company will offer it to 200 more. When 100 of those have been on the drug for 16 weeks with no major adverse effects, the company will begin to offer the drug to others."
"98","Jury in Barry Trial Meets for 5 1/2 Hours; Reaches No Verdict",373579,"|u.s.",4,8,1990,"19900804T000000","|WASHINGTON (DC)"," 
 The Federal jury weighing the 14 drug and conspiracy charges against Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. met for five and a half hours today without reaching a verdict. 
 The jury, nine women and three men, then suspended deliberations until Saturday morning. 
 Several times during the day the panel sent out notes to the Fdederal district judge hearing the case, Thomas Penfield Jackson, but the notes covered only minor matters and provided no clues as to how deliberations were going. 
 While considering one of the requests in a brief afternoon court session, Judge Jackson disclosed that a noisy undercover drug operation had taken place Thursday night at the hotel in suburban Maryland where the jury has been sequestered. A main charge against Mr. Barry resulted from an undercover drug operation at a hotel in Washington. 
 'Our Jurors Were Oblivious' 
 ''I was assured by our marshals that our jurors were oblivious to it all,'' Judge Jackson told prosecution and defense lawyers in this afternoon's court session. ''They may have known there was a disturbance, but they didn't know what it was.'' 
 In the Thursday night operation, police officials reported, drug agents tried to lure a suspect into buying $30,000 worth of cocaine. But the suspect became suspicious and fled, the officials said, setting off a noisy pursuit with helicopters and dogs. 
 The officials said the undercover agents were apparently unaware that the jury was staying at the hotel, the Sheraton in New Carrollton, Md. They identified the suspect as Brian Tribble, a friend of Len Bias, the All-American basketball star at the University of Maryland who died of a cocaine overdose in June 1986. Mr. Tribble was subsequently acquitted of charges that he had provided the cocaine. 
 Eighty religious leaders in the Washington area issued a statement today in which they asserted that there was a ''crisis of integrity'' in the city, a crisis they contended had been heightened by the divisive racial, political and legal issues surrounding Mr. Barry's trial."
"99","Stewart Wins 16th, Shutting Out Yanks",375292,"|sports",11,8,1990,"19900811T000000",NA," 
 The Yankees' modest little winning streak died tonight, even if their hope of climbing out of last place didn't. 
 They were done in, 3-0, by the Oakland Athletics and Dave Stewart, who gave up three hits and came within one out of a complete game in winning for the 16th time this season. The loss stopped the Yankees' longest winning streak of the season at five games. 
 Even so, the Yankees gained a half-game on sixth place in the American League East when the Milwaukee Brewers were swept in a doubleheader with the Royals at Kansas City. The events allowed the Yankees, who have been last since May 26, to close to within one game of sixth. 
 Stewart Has Streak Also 
 But they wilted tonight against Stewart, who retired 17 batters in a row from the second inning through the seventh and allowed only one hit after a leadoff single in the second by Kevin Maas. 
 Stewart, bidding to win 20 games for the fourth successive season, walked three and struck out eight. Rick Honeycutt came in to get the final out, striking out Mel Hall with two Yankees on base The last time the Yankees and the Athletics played here, they engaged in a monumental tussle of sorts. The pitchers were the same as tonight's - Dave LaPoint for the Yankees, Dave Stewart for Oakland - and the result was a 2-1 Athletics victory, produced when Rickey Henderson received a bases-loaded walk from Eric Plunk in the 11th inning. But that was May; this is August. Things have changed. LaPoint Keeps Pace The Yankees are out of the American League East chase, and the Athletics, predictably, are still leading in the West. Even so, LaPoint matched Stewart for three innings, kept the game close through four, then was suddenly gone in the fifth. 
 LaPoint, though, has had his success in Oakland. He pitched six scoreless innings in the two teams' earlier meeting and had a streak of 15 innings in which he did not allow a run there, dating to 1987. 
 But he was beset by control troubles from the start tonight, and only double plays in each of the first two innings kept the A's at bay early. In the fourth, the left-hander hit Terry Steinbach with a pitch, opening the way for Oakland's lead. 
 LaPoint followed by walking Mark McGwire, the fourth of five walks he issued, before striking out Felix Jose for the second out. But Walt Weiss lined a single to right, and Steinbach sprinted for the plate after deciding to challenge the throwing arm of Jesse Barfield. 
 Gets Results 
 It worked. Barfield's throw sailed over the head of the Yankee catcher, Brian Dorsett, making the score 1-0. 
 In the fifth, LaPoint faced problems again. Carney Lansford led off with a single - the fourth time in five innings that LaPoint allowed the first batter of the inning to reach base - and Willie Randolph, playing against his former team for the first time, put down a bunt. 
 Kevin Maas, the Yankee first baseman, couldn't make the throw in time, and Randolph was credited with a hit. Lansford went to second. Jose Canseco fouled out behind the plate, but Lansford stole third, and Dave Henderson walked to load the bases. 
 Steinbach then lined a two-run single to left field, pushing the lead to 3-0, and LaPoint was pulled by Manager Stump Merrill in favor of Eric Plunk. 
 The Yankees are battling for more than just a little respect in the division. They're also battling bus drivers - or at least, their traveling secretary, Bill Emslie, is. Witnesses say Emslie and the driver assigned to take a busload of team personnel and members of the press from the Kingdome to the airport in Seattle late Thursday night became involved in a shoving match. Emslie was apparently angry over the driver's inability to find the correct entrance to the tarmac. The airport police were called, and the team's flight here was delayed about an hour. Emslie refused to comment today about the incident.

"102","New York Police Seek 9,000 Officers",388307,"|new york|region",2,10,1990,"19901002T000000","|NEW YORK CITY|NEW YORK CITY"," 
 After months of self-analysis, the New York City Police Department has called for expanding its forces by more than 9,000 officers - about a third already budgeted, a third coming from internal economies and replacement by civilian workers, and a third from money not yet found. 
 The plan, worked out in discussions between the police and senior city officials and to be made public today by Mayor David N. Dinkins, embodies sweeping changes in long-established police procedures, including a sharp scaling back of 911 emergency service, which has become the bane of the department. 
 It also seeks to shift to the Department of Correction and other city agencies jobs long borne by the police, freeing up hundreds of officers assigned to the Police Department's court division. 
 Transit and Housing Included 
 Mayor Dinkins must still come up with hundreds of millions of dollars to finance the plan, which would create the largest department in the city's history, well over the 31,000 of 1970. In addition to the new regular city police, the plan calls for 690 new transit and housing officers, beyond 762 additional officers already budgeted but not yet recruited or trained. 
 Along with the beefing-up of forces, aides said that Mayor Dinkins would propose today that from now on, all new officers hired be required to be residents of the city. The change would require legislative approval. 
 Yesterday's figures provided by City Hall officials on the eve of the report's release and following a week of fluctuating leaked figures, broke down as follows: 
 * Beyond the 26,000 uniformed officers now, the department has identified a need for 9,603 additional officers on the streets. 
 * Roughly one-third, 3,124, would be made available by hiring about 2,700 additional civilian aides - there are about 7,500 now -who could replace officers in desk, training and staff jobs, allowing them to assume patrol duties; and the elimination, consolidation and sharing of other unit duties. 
 * About another third, 3,063, have already been provided for in the budget and are scheduled to go through the Police Academy between now and June 30. This number includes 1,058 additional officers added on by Mayor Dinkins earlier this year, 358 added on and financed by the City Council and about 1,700 ''attrition'' replacements for officers who retire. 
 * The third group, 3,416 officers, would be truly new - that is, they are neither already in the department in non-patrol jobs, nor have they been already budgeted or otherwise reckoned in department expansion plans. 
 Because the group of 3,063 that had already been budgeted was often not broken out by city officials, recent news accounts left the impression that nearly 6,000 ''new'' officers would be sought. In reality, little more than half that number were truly newfound troops. 
 The city's two specialized police forces would also grow under the plan. 
 The transit police, now 4,562 strong, would gain 440 new officers over the 442 already budgeted. And the housing police, now at 2,488, would gain 250 over the 320 already provided for. 
 Altogether, the 4,106 truly new officers proposed for the three departments would cost the city $215 million a year, including benefits, the report says. When the new civilian aides and other expenses are added the costs amount to $649 million, City Hall aides said yesterday. 
 The so-called manpower report, in the making since May, offers a unit-by-unit analysis of each component in the Police Department, where the staffing stands now and what it should be increased or reduced to. 
 Reducing 911 Calls 
 One of the more striking recommendations is a sharp reduction of the 4.1 million 911 emergency calls the department responds to a year - already less than half the 8.3 million that are telephoned in. By ''differentiating'' between true emergencies and calls that can be handled routinely, the department plans to save the equivalent of several hundred officers. 
 Similarly, 492 police officers are currently assigned to the court division, guiding prisoners through arraignments and other court appearances. These functions should be shifted to correction officers, freeing many more police officers for street duty, the report said. 
 In addition, it calls for the elimination of many small, special purpose units, such as the Safe, Loft and Truck Squad, an anti-hijacking unit whose functions are to be assumed by existing units. 
 The Detective Bureau, now below strength at under 2,500, is scheduled for augmentation by several hundred detectives, although some of the city-wide and borough functions are to be redistributed to precinct squads, in line with Commissioner Lee P. Brown's stated goal of moving as many operations to the local level as possible."

"104","Expansion Is Not Taken Lightly",392841,"|sports",18,10,1990,"19901018T000000",NA," 
 No final decisions are expected to be made today, but serious discussions are likely when the National Hockey League's franchise and market analysis committee meets in New York with representatives from nine prospective expansion franchises. 
 The meetings are expected to last all day with many top league executives scheduled to attend. The meeting comes amid posturing and saber-rattling in several quarters as the league plans to redefine its shape and size after a decade of prosperity and stability. 
 For example, the Winnipeg Jets, who joined the N.H.L. from the World Hockey Association in 1979, may be looking for a new home. 
 ''The future depends on a new building,'' said Mike Smith, general manager of the Jets. ''If there is no new building, the Jets will not be in Winnipeg, perhaps as soon as next year.'' 
 A feasibility study for a new arena is under way in Winnipeg. Last week, the Milwaukee application for an expansion franchise was withdrawn. Lloyd Pettit, who headed the bid, said the $50 million fee was too expensive. 
 He still wants to buy an existing team and move it to the new building in Milwaukee. 
 The N.H.L. hopes to expand from 21 to 28 teams in this decade and has already awarded a franchise to San Jose, to begin next season in a temporary home, the Cow Palace, San Francisco. The league said it wanted to award at least two franchises this December, so they could start play in 1992-93, but league sources say now that the December deadline is not a firm one. 
 Only nine groups remain in the bidding for the six available franchises. Four of those groups are situated in two market areas. The areas are southern California (Anaheim and San Diego) and the West Coast of Florida (Tampa and St. Petersburg). So, realistically, the league is considering seven market areas for six new teams. The other bids come from Seattle, Miami, Houston, Hamilton and Ottawa. 
 The league says the $50 million expansion fee is firm, although the Minnesota North Stars were sold last spring for $31.5 million. The Stars' former owners, the Gund brothers, had threatened to move the team to San Jose. Instead, they sold it and got an expansion franchise. The Stars' new owner, Norman Green, said he wanted to renegotiate the deal that will allow the Gunds to draft 30 players from the Minnesota organization after this season.  An Awkward Situation 
 When Jacques Demers goes to work Saturday night in Quebec, he will face an awkward situation rarely encountered by any coach or reporter. Demers is a color commentator for radio broadcasts of Nordiques games. He also does interviews with visiting players in their locker rooms. The visiting team this Saturday is the Detroit Red Wings, who dismissed Demers last summer after he spent four seasons as their coach. 
 ''I don't know if I will go in their dressing room; I don't know if I would feel comfortable,'' Demers said in a telephone interview from his apartment in Quebec. 
 Does he feel comfortable looking over the shoulder of Dave Chambers, the first-year coach of the Nordiques? 
 ''There is no problem,'' Demers said. ''I went in right away and I said, 'Dave, I am not looking for your job.' I'm not second-guessing him. He knows I'm not sniffing around.'' 
 Not that Demers would turn down approaches from elsewhere. He was coach of the year with Detroit in 1987 and 1988. 
 ''I've only been fired once in 18 years,'' he said. ''It's quite possible I could get one or two offers down the road.'' 
 He says the toughest part of the job is speaking French. Although he grew up in Montreal in a French-speaking family, Demers has lived most of his adult life in English-speaking cities. 
 ''There are some words I've forgotten,'' he said.  Messier Out Four Weeks 
 Mark Messier's knee injury is expected to keep the Edmonton star out for at least four weeks. . . . Ken Baumgartner, the Islanders' acting player representative, released a heavy-metal record called ''The Bomber'' this week on Metal Blade records. . . . Sergei Fedorov, Detroit's rookie center from the Soviet Union, has 4 points in seven games, works on the power play and is impressive on every shift. Also among this season's impressive rookies are Jaromir Jagr of Pittsburgh, Mike Richter of the Rangers, Mats Sundin of Quebec and Rob Blake of Los Angeles. It may be one of the league's best rookie crops in several seasons. . . . The Buffalo Sabres Wednesday night retired the No. 11 of Gilbert Perreault, who finished his career in 1986-87. . . . Eric Lindros, projected as the top draft choice next summer in the 18-year-old draft, has 10 goals and 14 assists in the first 10 games of the season for the Oshawa Generals, the defending Memorial Cup champions of Canada. The Generals, of the Ontario Hockey League, are 8-1-1. Lindros denies rumors that he will refuse to play for Quebec if the Nordiques get the first draft choice and choose him.

 Jon Rose is an Australian violinist and composer with a taste for the absurd. In his curriculum vitae, which served as program notes for his concert on Wednesday evening at the Kitchen, he asserted - among many other things - that he had been a fighter ace in the Imperial Japanese Air Force in World War II, had climbed Mount Everest, had won a Nobel Peace Prize for a book about Yehudi Menuhin and had given violin lessons to the Beatles. He also wrote that he was born in 1921, but he looks to be in his early 40's. 
 Mr. Rose's sense of humor is equally evident in his music. In a program of four works offered under the collective title ''Space Violins,'' he played an electric fiddle and manipulated a welter of synthesizer sounds that served as his accompaniment. 
 It was difficult to tell whether the sweeping, conductorial gestures he made with his bow actually controlled the electronics or whether his motions were merely balletic. He clearly intended to give the impression that there was a correlation between gesture and sound, although it often seemed as if the computer were careening off on its own. In his first piece, Mr. Rose's sound was often abrasive, in a fingernails-on-the-chalkboard kind of way, and it was some time before a listener could determine whether he could actually play the violin or was just using it as a classy noisemaker. But from the cacophony arose jazz riffs, passages of complex spiccato bowing and parodies of Paganini-style virtuosity. 
 In other pieces, there were fleeting moments of lyricism, particularly in the chordal introduction of the third piece. And in the second piece - in many ways the wittiest - there were fleeting references to Classical pieces, along with a parody of Neapolitan song in which Mr. Rose accompanied himself by using his fiddle as a mandolin. 
 Mostly, though, Mr. Rose toyed with a kaleidoscopic array of timbres. From one moment to the next, his violin might sound like a subway car screeching to a halt, a wailing imitation of Jimi Hendrix's guitar or a gently gurgling mechanical toy. The synthesizer sounds were equally varied, ranging from the bleeps and squeaks of 1960's-vintage Morton Subotnick to smooth tones that simulated voices and flutes. 
 In his closing piece, Mr. Rose put down his violin in favor of a pair of bows, one of which was amplified. At first he played it as if he were a Boy Scout trying to build a campfire, and from there the performance grew steadily more exotic. The sounds were not quite so varied as in the violin pieces, though. In the end he relented, playing a gentle coda with the amplified bow on an unamplified violin and thereby bringing a raucous evening to a graceful close."
"106","Dinkins's Fiscal General For an Unpopular War",399532,"|new york|region",10,11,1990,"19901110T000000","|NEW YORK CITY"," 
 Philip R. Michael, the director of New York City's Office of Management and Budget, is the orchestrator of the city's campaign to slash and burn its way through agency budgets to close a budget gap of more than $1.6 billion for the coming fiscal year. 
 While Mr. Michael's demeanor may not be abrasive, his policies often are. Several former staff members say he angered senior budget officials soon after he arrived by promising to rid the office of what he said was its arrogance toward other agencies. Unpopular by Definition 
 At the same time, some officials contend that Mr. Michael has not grasped the details of the city's budget, losing battles with other city department heads because he did not have the numbers to back up his arguments. 
 And he is vilified regularly by the city's union leaders, who resent his efforts to block labor settlements that they have been seeking in negotiations. 
 ""He is limited in his thinking,"" said Barry Feinstein, the head of local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. ""He is unimaginative. Hecomes with a bias against public employees. He thinks that the first thing you do with a problem is lay off the public work force."" 
 What has become clear to Mr. Michael since he took the $104,500-a-year post in January is that, as one former Koch administration official said recently, it is ""not a job for somebody who wants to be liked."" 
 Yet at a time of increasingly bleak fiscal news, the budget chief is emerging as one of the most important officials in city government. In the months ahead, his recommendations will be central to whatever plans the Dinkins administration formulates. 
 ""The risks are very high,"" Mr. Michael said in an interview. ""None of us want to have the prospect of losing control over the city's management. Clearly that is a risk right now."" 
 Mr. Michael, who is 50 years old, said he intended to reshape the office. Four of its five deputy budget directors have left since his arrival, and former staff members say morale is low. Mr. Michael admits he is ""somewhat isolated"" from his 450 staff members. 
 ""I have not wandered in and out of the offices as much as I should have,"" he said. 
 Management and Budget has often been viewed as an elite department, attracting some of the most promising and best educated employees. A staff member works about two or three months of overtime a year, although ""burnout"" is common and the turnover high, Mr. Michael said. 
 Mr. Michael, while praising the talents of his staff, said the days of its high-handedness towards other city agencies had ended. Yet he has not been timid about going into other city departments to clean house. 
 When Mr. Michael took over the Finance Department under Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1980, he cut about 90 percent of the top staff, some 25 people, in his first two months in the job. 
 ""When I got here it was almost like the fox in the chicken coop,"" he said of his arrival at the Office of Management and Budget. ""I had certain predispositions about O.M.B. I thought O.M.B. needed to be changed. The main change is that they should have an appreciation about how agencies work. They had an arrogant attitude that things had to be done because they said so, and this didn't sit well with me.""  Eschewing 'Micromanagement' 
 ""If O.M.B. ever lost an issue, it was a real slap in the face,"" he said, ""and it finally got to a point where O.M.B. never lost an issue. 
 ""If you reach a point where you end up winning every single argument, you get careless with the arguments you present,"" he said, ""and I think a lot of that happened."" 
 Mr. Michael said he wanted to turn the office from ""a micromanagement number-crunching operation, where we catch the agencies at every turn,"" to an office that works ""with them to improve the way they run their agencies."" 
 He also said he did not believe that his job required him to master every detail of the budget. That view puts him at odds with many of his predecessors, who prided themselves on knowing the intricacies of the city's finances.  Fiscal Constraints 
 Mr. Michael acknowledges that the the city's fiscal problems may undermine his desire to build bridges with city agencies. 
 ""Even when you try to understand and be nondictatorial as far as the agencies are concerned and give them the opportunity to manage themselves, when you are in a terrible budget crisis all you can do is say cut, cut, cut,"" Mr. Michael said. ""I am not sure you end up being viewed any differently. 
 ""Eventually,"" he added, ""people hear the bad news so often and get so depressed by it that you get blamed for the bad news. That is territory that goes with the job."" 
 In the last few years, Mr. Michael said, rising city revenues lulled Management and Budget into becoming lax on how money was spent. 
 ""Every bad decision that agencies made, or blown initiatives that cost you a lot of money, got totally covered up by the fact that every time you looked into the till you had more money than you expected to find,"" he said. ""This covered up an awful lot of bad management.""  Father and Coach 
 Mr. Michael, a father of three, lives in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, where he coaches in the South Riverdale Little League. He was born in San Francisco and received bachelor's and law degrees from the University of California at Berkeley. A former Justice Department trial lawyer, he went to work for New York City in 1972 as a deputy police commissioner for trials. 
 At the Police Department, he discharged 256 police officers and fought a generous police pension plan that allowed officers to retire on full salary when they suffered certain illnesses -- what Mr. Michael considered minor ailments -- or heart attacks. 
 After serving as a deputy commissioner in the city's Department of Investigations and as finance commissioner, he left public office briefly in 1984, when he joined Merrill Lynch & Company as an investment banker. He then became general counsel to Sanus Health Systems, a health maintenance organization, in 1986. By 1989, however, he was back in government as director of the State Financial Control Board when David N. Dinkins chose him to head the city budget office. 
 ""Those were not good years,"" Mr. Michael said of his time in the private sector. ""They were very oriented simply towards how much money could be made. I found that a lot of things I was called on to do, for which I got paid pretty well, were pretty trivial."""

 To the Editor: 
 The New York City branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is saying no to using public funds to establish schools that separate black boys from their female peers and other ethnic groups. Laws on segregation and integration are at issue here. 
 As a whole, children of African descent in our city's public schools are not progressing as well as they can; particularly black boys. There is no question that actions must be taken to remove the impediments in the school setting that prevent them from doing their best work. However, further segregation is not the way to do that. Effective educational models will work for all children and can be established for the population mix in the schools that serve our children. 
 As we focus on educational issues that relate to a global community, an international work force, a pluralistic society and multicultural education for the year 2000 and beyond, we see a disadvantage to greater segregation. Quick fixes frequently contain other problems that come back to haunt us down the road. NONA E. SMITH Director, Project Excellence New York City N.A.A.C.P. New York, Nov. 2, 1990"

 Q. 
 Our screened porch has a slate floor. There are some paint spots on it, and the floor is rather dusty. We would like to apply a sealer, but we want to remove the paint spots first. How would you suggest we go about it? 
 A. Your best bet is to use a semipaste paint remover to try and remove the paint spots. Try this on a mild day, preferably when the temperature inside the porch is at least 60 degrees. Brush the remover over the paint spots in a thick layer, cover with plastic kitchen wrap, and allow to stand for about two hours. Take off the plastic, immediately scrub the floor with detergent and water, and rinse with plain water. Repeat if all the paint does not come out. Some of the white may still be visible. If so, try washing with a muriatic-acid solution of 1 part acid to 4 parts water. Soak for five minutes, and then flush it off with water. Make sure the floor dries for several days before applying the sealer. 
 Q. 
 Can you touch up scratches and worn spots on a floor whose finish is polyurethane? 
 A. It is almost impossible to do that without the touch-ups being noticeable after the work is done, but you can try. Sand the area carefully with No. 220 paper, making certain not to miss any places. Then wipe off the sanding dust with a rag moistened with paint thinner. When applying the polyurethane, try to ""feather it out"" around the edges. Apply a second coat within the time specified on the label, again feathering it out carefully."

 THERE is adventure for older people, and Ruth Humleker has found it. 
 A year ago, Mrs. Humleker, who is 68 years old, joined the Peace Corps and traveled to Yemen. Her assignment was cut short last summer after only three months because of the Persian Gulf crisis. But she will soon leave for Paraguay and a new assignment, which she hopes will last two years. 
 ""I just could not play bridge for the next 20 years, and I know many other older people want to do constructive work,"" Mrs. Humleker said, explaining why she joined the Peace Corps. ""My husband died two years ago, and I figured there was still time for adventure."" 
 Mrs. Humleker said the Peace Corps wanted to enlist older people, even those in their 80's, as well as young people. ""One out of six applicants is accepted,"" she said. 
 As a result of her first assignment, she found ""older persons highly revered in Yemen."" 
 The Peace Corps concurs, saying ""host governments want more older volunteers."" 
 Before joining the Peace Corps, Mrs. Humleker worked for a number of years as an arts administrator and author. ""I was an associate director of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts,"" she explained. She visited Leningrad in 1979 and arranged to bring an exhibit from the Hermitage museum to the United States. Then the Soviet Union invaded Afganistan, and the project was canceled. 
 Last August, Mrs. Humleker experienced another disappointment. The United States Ambassador to Yemen, Charles F. Dunbar, ordered the 70 Peace Corps workers there to return to the United States because of the gulf crisis. 
 ""We were about to complete training, which included learning Arabic,"" Mrs. Humleker said. ""I was assigned to teach English, but I never got the chance."" 
 Nevertheless, Mrs. Humleker has some pleasant memories of Yemen. ""We ate at the training center where food was very good, prepared by Yemeni cooks,"" Mrs. Humleker said. 
 She also recalled a visit one day by a young Yemeni woman on the staff. The woman had asked if she could bring her lunch to Mrs. Humleker's room. Once there, she pulled off her chador -- a large square cloth traditionally worn as a face covering by Moslem women -- and her black robe, revealing lipstick, blue jeans and a T-shirt. Mrs. Humleker said the young woman began to cry complaining that she could never get away from the chador or study abroad because of the war in the Persian Gulf. 
 After returning home, Mrs. Humleker asked for another assignment, but she had to wait about six months because 300 Peace Corps workers had been evacuated from Liberia and the Philippines and most of them had also applied for reassignment. 
 ""You can indicate where you want to go and where you will not serve,"" she said. Hoping for faster acceptance, she left these lines blank. 
 In May, she departs with a group headed for Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay, where she will undergo three months of training. Having studied Spanish in college, she said she was sure her fluency in the language would return. ""We also have to learn an Indian language called Guarani,"" she said. 
 This time she will be a business adviser. ""There has been a large cooperative movement in Paraguay, and I will be assigned to help,"" she said. ""After all, I was an arts administrator. We probably will be stationed outside of the capital."" 
 Pay in the Peace Corps is minimal, differing from country to country. She received about $30 a month during her training in Yemen, plus food, lodging and her air fare. After the training period, she will receive a small stipend, which she described ""as subsistence level,"" to cover all her living expenses. Later, there is a readjustment based on months served. 
 Though the pay is low, Mrs. Humleker said she managed to put her Social Security checks and other income in the bank each month while she was in Yemen. She plans to do the same in Paraguay. 
 When Mrs. Humleker leaves for Paraquay, she will be traveling light. 
 ""We can take only 80 pounds of luggage,"" she said. A dictionary, a thesaurus, a small paperback encyclopedia, and a couple of plays by Shakespeare are among the books she will be taking with her. 
 ""This time, I am also taking a portable typewriter,"" she said. 
 Meanwhile, not content to rest, she has been updating a book she wrote, ""New York for the Independent Traveler,"" published by Marlor Press of Minneapolis. After her stint in South America, she hopes to do a book tentatively called ""The Old Lady Goes to Yemen and Paraguay."""

 The people of Albania, blinking in the first political daylight they have been exposed to in almost five decades, will vote on Sunday in multiparty elections organized by the governing Communist Party. 
 The outcome is unclear. No polls have been taken. But the Communists, led by President Ramiz Alia, are under pressure from a popular democratic movement launched by Tirana University students in December. 
 While the Communists hold their final election rallies for relatively small numbers of the party faithful behind the doors of meeting halls, the newly formed Democratic Party headed by a charismatic cardiologist, Dr. Sali Berisha, has convened its supporters in the open, drawing about 90,000 to its last rally in the capital on Friday. Tirana has a population of 300,000. 
 These are the first contested elections here since 1923, but in that year Albania still had a semifeudal society and the candidates were chosen mainly by clans.  Push for Freedoms 
 Albania is Europe's poorest country and it has been governed since 1944 by a Stalinist regime formed by Enver Hoxha. He died in 1985 after naming Mr. Alia to succeed him. Last May, plainly concerned by the fall of Communist governments across Eastern Europe in 1989, President Alia opened what he called a process of ""democratization."" 
 But a huge number of Albanians, disgusted with the Communists' disastrous economic policies and abuse of basic human rights, soon made it clear that they wanted their freedom far faster than the Government was were prepared to allow. 
 They stormed foreign embassies by the thousands to gain asylum. They commandeered boats to cross the Adriatic to Italy. They demanded and obtained the opening of churches and mosques closed in 1967 as part of an official campaign against all religious worship. 
 Dozens of demonstrators were killed in clashes with the police, but the protests compelled the release of 329 political prisoners, some of whom had been jailed for as long as 30 years. They also forced Mr. Alia to sack a dozen Cabinet ministers and form a new Government last month. 
 In the same period, Mr. Alia sought to improve his image here by opening diplomatic relations with the United States, inviting American and other foreign observers to monitor the elections and declaring Albania's willingness to adhere to human-rights conventions under the 1975 Helsinki agreement. 
 But those and other concessions by the Communist Government may have come too grudgingly and too slowly to give the 65-year-old President a strong edge in the balloting, especially among the young, who make up perhaps one million of the 1.8 million electorate. 
 Mr. Alia's stump speeches indicate a sense of doubt about his party's chances. Repeatedly he said, ""We made mistakes."" On Friday at his first news conference, he said, ""I am not a dictator,"" adding that the Communists would accept defeat ""if that is the will of the people."" 
 In contrast to the polite applause accorded to Mr. Alia and other Communist candidates for the 250-seat Parliament, huge crowds of Albanians cheered wildly for the candidates of the Democratic Party in the cities and even in remote mountain villages. 
 Near the port of Durres, four young Albanian soldiers walking on the highway this afternoon were carrying Democratic Party placards, flashing ""V"" signs to passing motorists. 
 The Communists still appear to have some strength in the countryside, which the opposition parties have had difficulty penetrating. Sixty percent of the Albanians live in rural communities. 
 The Democratic Party was founded in December by Dr. Berisha with Gramoz Pashko, an economics professor, together with a few student leaders and a worker. Other parties have also sprung up but have not gained widespread support. 
 The Alia Government has provided the opposition parties with space for campaign headquarters, some telephones and some automobiles in this country where private car ownership was banned until this month. 
 The Democrats have pledged to bring Albania ""into Europe"" and to create genuine ""freedom and liberty."" They have also hinted broadly that American economic assistance for Albania would be generous if they win."
"113","For Kennedy, No Escaping a Dark Cloud",438021,"|front page|u.s.",17,4,1991,"19910417T000000","|PALM BEACH (FLA)"," 
 After two weeks of tabloid headlines, ""Geraldo"" shows and dark gossip, all stemming from an allegation of rape at the Kennedy compound in Palm Beach, Fla., Senator Edward M. Kennedy went to American University today to recall the glory days of the Kennedy family. 
 Most of his speech was a smoothly delivered, impassioned appeal for a comprehensive new effort to aid children. But because the event was organized by the university to recall a major address delivered there 28 years ago by President John F. Kennedy, the Senator looked back as well. When he did, he struggled several times for composure. 
 It was one more scene in the familiar morality play that has played out in Washington in recent days, on the two images of Edward Kennedy: the powerful Senator who is caretaker of the family legacy and the hard-drinking roue. 
 While the accusation of rape was leveled against William Kennedy Smith, the Senator's nephew, the Senator was engulfed in the furor, particularly in the first days after the March 30 incident. Critics noted that the episode occurred after the 59-year-old Senator had spent the evening at a bar with his nephew and son. Many cited the memory of Chappaquiddick, and some raised the possibility of a cover-up. 
 Old Kennedy loyalists rose to the Senator's defense and railed at what they saw as the unfairness of the news coverage. ""I've taken my nephew out and had beers with him, and I don't think it's an offense,"" said Bob Shrum, a former Kennedy speech writer and Democratic political consultant. ""I don't think anybody else does either."" 
 Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the conservative Republican from Utah who is Mr. Kennedy's friend, said: ""I did tell him, if I hear of any more of these things, I'm going to send the Mormon missionaries to him. He said, 'I'm about ready.' "" 
 But attempts at humor were faltering. ""I feel sorry for all the Kennedys,"" said Mr. Hatch. He added, ""I certainly feel sorry for the young woman, too."" 
 In the halls of Congress, some of Mr. Kennedy's colleagues in the Senate shook their heads and marveled at how, as one Democratic Senator put it, ""The guy just can't seem to get out from under a black cloud."" The Reaction Is Polarized 
 The reaction, as is so often the case with the Kennedys, was fiercely polarized. A column in The Boston Globe by Mike Barnicle declared: ""Surrounded by sycophants, Edward Kennedy thinks his name and title are license to do whatever he wants, and apparently the only voice he hears in that dark lonely time before danger calls is the drink saying, 'Go ahead, you can get away with anything.' "" Mr. Barnicle asserted that Mr. Kennedy, who is not up for re-election until 1994, was finished in politics. 
 That same day, The Globe ran another column, by Dave Nyhan, headlined, ""Flaws, yes -- but Kennedy still champions the little guy."" 
 Mr. Kennedy, meanwhile, went about his duties. His press secretary said he was ""concerned but not distracted from his work,"" and his schedule seemed intended to underscore that. He voted against the nomination of Kenneth L. Ryskamp, a Federal District judge in Miami, to an important appellate court seat; held a hearing on the Kurdish refugees; conducted a news conference about military-base closings; delivered today's speech at American University. Liberal Standard-Bearer 
 Even many of his critics acknoweldge that Mr. Kennedy is one of the most influential Senators on Capitol Hill, perhaps the most visible standard-bearer for liberal causes. Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington research organization, said Mr. Kennedy's occasional appearances in the tabloids were unlikely to change that. ""It's happened again and again, and I think it's discounted inside the chamber,"" said Mr. Mann. 
 ""What it does is sort of underscore the limits of Ted Kennedy's role in national politics,"" Mr. Mann added. Controversies involving Mr. Kennedy and his family are no longer viewed through the prism of a possible Presidential campaign, the Brookings analyst said. 
 As the days have passed, Mr. Kennedy's allies have noted that the focus of Palm Beach controversy has moved away from the Senator. His speech today at American University was planned well before the Palm Beach episode occurred but offered him an opportunity to talk of issues and the family's golden era. 
 The university was commemorating a commencement address delivered there on June 10, 1963, in which President Kennedy announced that the United States, British and Soviet Governments had agreed to convene new negotiations in Moscow on a treaty to ban nuclear-weapons tests. He spelled out ""a strategy of peace"" and said what he hoped for was not ""a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war"" but ""genuine peace."" 
 As for today's appearance by a different Kennedy, there were attempts to organize a protest, but only a handful appeared. A few said the money for the Kennedy commemoration could have been better spent; a few said they challenged Mr. Kennedy's ""moral fitness"" to be Senator. 
 But the audience was large and respectful. 
 Mr. Kennedy drew applause as he urged the creation of a $10 billion new effort for chidren's education and health, including $5 billion in Federal funds -- ""or six days' cost of running the Department of Defense."" Alone With His Thoughts 
 His delivery was smooth until he reached the close of his speech, when he began to talk about his brother. ""Some of the most moving photographs of President Kennedy portray him in the Oval Office -- not with heads of state or Cabinet members -- but with his son and daughter,"" Mr. Kennedy said. ""I think of his warm smile as he watched Caroline and John play hide-and-seek around his desk."" 
 Mr. Kennedy stopped speaking, looked down intently at his speech, and paused for a very long time. It happened two or three times more before he finished. ""After the passage of so many years, those photographs are still extremely moving,"" he said. ""They tell us something not only about my brother, but about Americans as a people."" 
 The students, most of whom were not born when those photographs were taken, listened quietly and gave Mr. Kennedy a standing ovation when he ended. With the smooth advance work that the Kennedys are known for, the Senator left quickly, with a large pack of reporters at his heels, calling his name."
"114","Subpoena Jolts Black Mayors' Meeting",441173,"|u.s.",27,4,1991,"19910427T000000","|CLEVELAND (OHIO)"," 
 A gathering of the nation's black mayors was jolted Thursday night when most of the guests learned that their host, Mayor Michael R. White of Cleveland, had been summoned before a county grand jury investigating a real estate investment he made eight years ago. 
 While many local political leaders, including Mr. White, had expected the Mayor to be subpoenaed, most were caught off guard by the timing. The subpoena was served Wednesday, the opening day of the meeting. 
 Coming as it did during the National Conference of Black Mayors, one of the largest annual gatherings of black elected officials in the nation, the incident reinforced the feeling among many of the mayors that black public officials were being selected for investigation. Hottest Issue at Meeting 
 The conference has drawn abut 400 people to discuss issues like municipal finance and housing for people with low incomes. But the most talked about issue has been the investigation. 
 Mr. White, who took office a little more than a year ago, was a partner in two real estate projects that are being investigated for possible charges of theft and unlawful interest in a public contract. 
 The projects, involving the conversion of school buildings into apartments for the disabled and the elderly, and Mr. White's involvement with them were the subject of news reports shortly after Mr. White was elected. 
 The investigation centers on whether Mr. White, who was a member of the City Council and chairman of its community development committee at the time, improperly used his position to indirectly assist the development projects in which he was an investor, people involved in the case say. 
 The County Attorney Stephanie Tubbs Jones, a Democrat, said today that the grand jury proceedings were secret. She declined to comment on the timing of the subpoena or other matters relating to the case. Racial Motivation Discounted 
 That Ms. Jones is black has led some local politicians to discount the theory that the investigation and the timing of the subpoena were racially motivated. Indeed, some political leaders here have suggested that the investigation was proper and that the timing was merely an unfortunate, albeit embarrassing, coincidence. 
 The investigation was begun by Ms. Jones's predecessor, John T. Corrigan, a Democrat who is white. 
 Nonetheless, many here suggested that the timing of Mr. White's subpoena was at the very least designed to embarrass the Mayor at a time when he was in the spotlight. Mr. White will also be the host of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of Democrats who say they are seeking to move the party to the center and which will begin a three-day meeting here on May 5. 
 Mr. White, who has never suggested that the investigation or the grand jury action was racially motivated, said that he did nothing wrong. He also said that he had secured an opinion from the Ohio Ethics Commission, a state agency, that there were no improprieties in his dealings in the projects in 1983 and 1984. 
 At an impromptu news conference at the reception, Mr. White read a statement saying, ""Given all the publicity that has surrounded this particular case, this subpoena is not completely unexpected."" 
 He said he was ""in close consultation with legal counsel and will consult them as to an appropriate response."" 'Tacky as It Gets' 
 Among those who expressed dismay over the service of the subpoena was the newly elected Mayor of Kansas City, Emanuel Cleaver. 
 ""I thought the timing of the subpoena was as tacky as it gets,"" Mr. Cleaver said. ""Every black mayor I have talked with, and many of my white supporters, have told me enough about black officials becoming targeted for investigation that I have become as paranoid as I can get."" 
 Walter R. Tucker, the Mayor of Compton, Calif., expressed a similar sentiment. ""The timing of this subpoena certainly has a suspicious nature to it,"" he said. ""When you consider that the event being investigated occurred eight years ago and that the investigation has been going on for several months, you have to ask: why have they decided to do this in the middle of the National Conference of Black Mayors?"" 
 The mayors gave Mr. White a standing ovation today at a luncheon that featured Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services.Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, was also presented a service award at the luncheon. 
 Many of the mayors said the standing ovation was designed to show solidarity with Mr. White.  Other Cases Cited 
 Some said in interviews here that Mr. White's situation was reminiscent of other recent investigations of black officials. 
 Some cited the recent tax evasion and embezzlement case against Representative Floyd H. Flake, Democrat of Queens. The charges were dropped at the request of prosecutors earlier this month. 
 Others cited a Federal Grand Jury indictment of 10 legislators in South Carolina, four of whom were black, on charges involving bribery and drugs as part of a Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry of vote buying in that state's legislature. 
 Mayor Johnny Ford of Tuskegee, Ala., said that when a black official is elected, ""you get yourself in a fish bowl."" 
 ""To me, as a black mayor,"" he said, ""it is obvious that there are efforts to discredit African-American officials. We all know that and it's real and we have to be careful."""

 MARIAN ANDERSON, the great contralto, has rarely been seen in public in recent years, but tonight she will make an exception when she goes to the Kennedy Center for a showing of a new film about her life. The program, which simply bears her name, is to be shown Wednesday on public broadcasting stations across the country. Earlier in the day, accompanied by her nephew JAMES DuPRIEST, a conductor, and SHARON PERCY ROCKEFELLER, she is to go to the White House for tea with BARBARA BUSH and a photo with PRESIDENT BUSH. Now 89 and a resident of Danbury, Conn., Miss Anderson gave her farewell concert at Carnegie Hall in 1965. 
 ""She is an extraordinary person who broke many barriers,"" said Mrs. Rockefeller, president of WETA, the public radio and television station in Washington that produced the film.  ""She has the voice that Toscanini said you only hear once every 100 years, and she has been a role model for many young performers."""
"117","Washington Bank Seized",444543,"|business",11,5,1991,"19910511T000000","|WASHINGTON (DC)"," 
 Federal bank regulators today seized the Madison National Bank, one of the largest in the Washington area, after declaring it insolvent. 
 Madison is to be sold to Signet Bank for $18 million. 
 Banking officials estimated that the failure of Madison would ultimately cost the fund that insures deposits almost $150 million. All depositors, even those with uninsured accounts of more than $100,000, will be protected. Madison's shareholders will lose their investments. 
 The move caps three years of problems at the bank, which had an unusually high concentration of loans for real estate and construction and had been unable to comply with regulatory standards. 
 Trying to keep Madison afloat, regulators last year permitted the bank to borrow heavily from the Federal Reserve. But the borrowing could not offset the mounting losses on loans to real estate developers and to many of the bank's executives, and the losses eventually exceeded the bank's capital. 
 ""The downturn in the local economy contributed to the bank's problems,"" the office of the Comptroller of the Currency said in a statement released today. ""But Madison National Bank's poor underwriting standards, including making unsecured real estate loans, providing 100 percent financing of real estate projects, and lending based on character rather than cash flow, were major causes of the bank's failure."" 
 The banking company is the sixth largest in Washington. It had assets of $529 million as of Dec. 31."

 Former Yankee Andy Hawkins pitched five and one-third shutout innings in his Oakland debut and Dave Henderson hit his major league-leading 11th home run as the Athletics beat the Cleveland Indians, 3-0, today. 
 Hawkins (1-2) was released by the Yankees on May 9 after he went 0-2 with a 9.95 earned run average in four appearances. He agreed to terms with Oakland five days later and was added to their roster before Saturday's game. 
 The timing was perfect, because Hawkins has never lost or allowed an earned run at Cleveland Stadium. 
 In four career starts covering 31 innings in Cleveland, he is 4-0, including a three-hit shutout last year. 
 Hawkins gave up three hits, walked one and struck out two before leaving with one out in the sixth. The Indians got only one runner past first base against him, when Mike Huff walked and stole second in the first inning. 
 Joe Klink, the A's fourth pitcher, worked one and one-third scoreless innings and Dennis Eckersley finished the combined four-hitter. 
 Charles Nagy (1-3) took the loss, victimized by an error and lack of support. 
 Angels 4, Orioles 2 
 BALTIMORE (AP) -- Wally Joyner homered and drove in four runs, including a tiebreaking single in the ninth inning that led California over Baltimore. 
 Joyner went 3 for 4, raising his major league-leading average to .391. He is 27 for 55 (.491) in his last 14 games. His two-out, two-out single in the ninth made Chuck Finley (7-1) the winner. Royals 7, Brewers 4 
 KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Jim Eisenreich, Danny Tartabull and Carmelo Martinez hit bases-emply homers off reliever Mark Lee in the eighth inning, lifting Kansas City to a victory over Milwaukee. 
 The Royals tied it, 3-3, on Brian McRae's two-run homer in the seventh, before the Brewers took a 4-3 lead in the eighth. 
 Lee (0-2) relieved Don August to start the eighth and Eisenreich hit the third pitch over the right-field fence. Tartabull followed with a towering drive over the center-field wall and Martinez connected one out later. Twins 4, Tigers 1 
 DETROIT (AP) -- Shane Mack and Kirby Puckett each hit home runs as Minnesota sent Detroit to its eighth straight loss. 
 The eight-game skid is the longest for the Tigers since they lost 12 straight in 1989. 
 Mark Guthrie (3-2) gave up one run and five hits in six innings for the win. Rick Aguilera, who worked two innings for his seventh save, loaded the bases on three walks in the ninth, before Alan Trammell hit a fly ball to end the game. Blue Jays 9, White Sox 2 
 CHICAGO (AP) -- Rookie Ed Sprague hit his first major league homer and Jimmy Key pitched four-hit ball for seven innings as Toronto beat Chicago. 
 Key (6-2) struck out seven and walked one in improving to 14-5 lifetime against Chicago. Tom Henke, activated from the disabled list Friday, made his first appearance since April 10 and pitched a hitless ninth, striking out one. Expos 3, Giants 1 
 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Tim Burke recorded his 100th career save in relief of a strong effort by Dennis Oil Can Boyd as Montreal beat San Francisco. The Giants (12-24), who are currently last in the National League West, have lost 14 of their last 18 games. 
 Boyd (2-4) blanked the Giants on two singles through seven innings and was lifted when Robby Thompson opened the eighth with a double. 
 Burke retired the first two batters before pinch-hitter Kevin Mitchell was safe on third baseman Tim Wallach's throwing error, enabling Thompson to score from third. 
 Burke pitched a scoreless ninth for his fourth save of the season to finish the combined three-hitter. Phillies 5, Cubs 2 
 PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- John Kruk hit a two-run double and Ricky Jordan followed with a two-run single in the eighth inning to rally Philadelphia past Chicago.

"119","IRAQI ARMY AGREES TO A PULLOUT PLAN",447389,"|world",23,5,1991,"19910523T000000","|IRAQ|DOHUK (IRAQ)"," 
 In a potential breakthrough, allied and Iraqi military commanders agreed today that Iraqi soldiers and secret policemen would withdraw from the important Kurdish city of Dohuk and that allied forces would move in starting Friday. 
 Senior United States officers said that relatively few allied troops would be involved, perhaps 200 according to one rough estimate, among them 20 military police officers who are to provide security. 
 The commanders insisted that this did not amount to an expansion of the special zone created last month to protect Kurdish refugees returning to northern Iraq. Most of those being sent into Dohuk, including civilians, are technical experts charged with helping a war-torn city get back on its feet. 
 Lieut. Gen. John Shalikashvili, the United States Army officer in charge of the rescue operation, said the Dohuk situation would be assessed on a weekly basis to determine how long his troops would remain. 
 Nonetheless, the agreement pushes the allies deeper into northern Iraq in their search for a formula that will persuade refugees to go home. Most of them, some 200,000 people, come from Dohuk, which was largely evacuated by the Kurds as they fled into Turkey after their failed rebellion against President Saddam Hussein. 
 Getting them to return to the city, which lies outside the established security zone, is regarded as essential to resolve the continuing refugee crisis. But with near-unanimity the Kurds have said that it is unsafe for them there without some sort of allied shield. 
 The question now is whether the new military plan, a hard-won arrangement, will be the breakthrough that satisfies the Kurds. Initial reactions suggested perhaps not. 
 ""No, it's not enough,"" said Fadhil Merani, a representative of the Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani, as he went to a meeting with American commanders. Later, Mr. Merani softened his position, saying that ""something positive is coming"" and that people might return to Dohuk in two or three days. 
 But his tone was lukewarm, and another Kurd who attended the meeting said that he was not satisfied. 
 Throughout the crisis, allied leaders have said it is up to the Kurds to decide if they should go home, for it is they who have suffered repeated waves of repression under Mr. Hussein. 
 ""It is hopeful that what we are talking about today will satisfy most of their requirements,"" General Shalikashvili said after striking a deal with Lieut. Gen. Abu Firas Saber of the Iraqi general staff. 
 There seems to be some American exasperation with the Kurdish leaders, who are involved simultaneously in negotiations with the Iraqi Government over increased self-determination for Kurdish regions. Some officers feel that while the Kurds may have legitimate reasons to distrust Mr. Hussein, they may also want to keep the allies here as long as possible to strengthen their bargaining position. Kurdish Policemen Only 
 The agreement today calls for the few Iraqi soldiers still in Dohuk to pull back six miles south of the city by Friday morning. Mr. Hussein's secret police -- who are in abundance there, according to Kurds who have returned on scouting missions -- must also be gone. The Iraqis will be allowed to maintain a checkpoint outside the city, but it must be manned by policeofficers of Kurdish origin, to help make sure that returning refugees are not armed. 
 As the Iraqis withdraw, the allied force is supposed to move in. 
 There will be no combat troops, officials said, and security will be handled by the military police. Col. Lucious Delk, commander of the military police detachment here, said that about 20 officers would be sent but that their assignment is to protect other members of the allied contingent, not to patrol the city as troops do now in Zakho and other towns in the security zone. 
 Most of those being sent are engineers, medics and other specialists who are to help Dohuk return to normal. 
 An American and British survey team went there on Monday and found the city to be in better shape than they had thought, with Kurds starting to return from the mountains. But Dohuk still has deficiencies in sanitation, water supplies and electricity. In addition, hundreds of houses were destroyed and looted by Iraqi troops."
"120","Business Technology; Putting Pollen to Good Use: The Delivery of Drugs",450570,"|health|business",5,6,1991,"19910605T000000",NA," 
 At this time of year, few allergy sufferers need any reminder of pollen's ability to enter the body. Pollen inhaled, touched or eaten can cause eyes to itch and sinuses to clog. Now a Southern California company is working on a technology to deliver drugs by substituting them for the natural allergens in pollen grains. 
 Amer Particle Technologies Inc., based in Montecito, Calif., said its method could be an alternative to injection of protein-based drugs, like those created by the biotechnology companies. Because they are large molecules, proteins defy delivery through the nose or skin; because they are digested, they are not effective taken through the mouth. Amer believes its method would allow patients to take the drugs in skin creams, pills or nose sprays. Pollens could also be used for the controlled release of conventional drugs. 
 Pollen grains have impermeable outer membranes with equally spaced pores, so they are, in theory, suitable for the controlled release of any substance they can be made to contain. Different pollens have different structures, lending themselves to a wide range of release times and therapies. Pollen is also available in large quantities at reasonable prices. 
 Amer has conducted both test tube and animal studies, which it says show the practicality of delivering drugs with pollens. Suitable drugs might include growth hormones, birth control substances, blood-pressure medicines, sedatives and clot-dissolving substances. Amer has four patent applications pending covering drug delivery with pollens and synthetic replicas of pollens. But the company has not yet begun clinical trials, and marketable products are years away."
"121","More Exemptions at Open Needed",452344,"|sports",13,6,1991,"19910613T000000",NA," 
 TO understand how the United States Open assembles the 156 golfers who will tee off today at Hazeltine National, you need only to know the story of the resigning United States Golf Association official who wondered what to do with his blue blazer. 
 ""You can keep the blazer,"" he was informed, ""but you have to send the buttons back."" 
 At the Open, the buttons seem more important than the blazer. Ever since Francis Ouimet stunned Harry Vardon and Ted Ray in a 1913 playoff, the Open has thought of itself as the world's most prestigious golf tournament. But judging by the absence of a few winning touring pros from around the world and the PGA Tour, if the Open is to sustain its reputation, the United States Golf Association needs to increase its number of exempt players. 
 Yes, all the marquee names are here. But most of those marquee names now are Europeans: Nick Faldo, Ian Woosnam, Seve Ballesteros. Of the 10 leading Americans on the PGA Tour's money list, only Hale Irwin, the three-time Open champion who will be defending the championship he won at Medinah last year, won a major title in the 80's. 
 Faldo, Woosnam, Ballesteros and Irwin each emerged from at least one of the 12 categories of golfers exempt from local and sectional qualifying for various reasons, notably, winning the Open in the last 10 years, winning the Masters, British Open or Professional Golfers Association Championship in the last five years, the 15 leading finishers and ties in last year's Open. 
 But three winners on this year's PGA Tour are not here: Kenny Perry (the Memorial), Ted Schulz (Los Angeles Open), Jay Don Blake (Shearson Lehman San Diego Open). Also missing are several of the European PGA Tour's best players, notably Steve Richardson and Sam Torrance of England, Eduardo Romero of Argentina and David Feherty of Ireland. 
 Blake, the 10th leading money-winner on the PGA Tour, and Schultz failed in the sectional qualifying. Perry chose not to file an Open entry by the April 24 deadline. 
 If a touring pro is good enough to win a PGA Tour event this year, he's certainly good enough to win the Open or at least contend, as Blake did at Oak Hill two years ago. And a winning touring pro surely deserves a spot in the Open more than, say, an assistant pro from the Metal Woods Country Club who happens to qualify, then shoots 78-78 to miss the cut. 
 Of the 156 golfers here, at least 50 are virtual no-names whose chances of winning are slim and none. 
 Yes, the Open should be open to an assistant pro, but a spot should be preserved for a winner of a PGA Tour event who is not otherwise exempt from qualifying. At the Masters, the winner of any PGA Tour event during the previous 12 months is awarded an automatic invitation. 
 For the Open, the U.S.G.A. reserves the right to issue up to three special exemptions. This year only Jack Nicklaus, whose various exemptions had finally expired, was invited. 
 As for foreign golfers, the U.S.G.A. issued all seven of its exemptions this year. But with the dominance of European golfers lately, that's not enough. As the U.S.G.A. is aware. 
 ""We're thinking about changing some of the exempt categories for foreign golfers, but not about increasing the overall total of exemptions,"" said David Fay, the U.S.G.A. executive director. ""There's been no thought of adding PGA Tour winners to the exempt list. We have 64 exempt players in this year's Open and any more than that would be troubling to us. We want the Open to remain open."" 
 But unless changes occur, it will remain more difficult for an American to compete in the United States Open than the British Open. In the British Open, any American in the top 50 in the Sony world rankings is exempt from qualifying, along with anybody among the PGA Tour's top 10 money winners not otherwise exempt. 
 Until recently, the British Open needed to attract as many American golfers as possible. But now Europe has most of the marquee players. As the golfers themselves know better than anyone. 
 According to Tom Watson, whose current Open exemption expires after next year's return to his triumph at Pebble Beach, ""10 or 15 more exemptions for players around the world and in the U.S. would still allow plenty of open spots."" Faldo suggested that the four major tournaments (United States Open, British Open, Masters and PGA Championship) get together on exemptions. 
 ""If you finish high in one major,"" Faldo said, ""maybe you should be exempt in all the majors."" 
 But for the U.S.G.A., that might be too much like saying you can keep the blazer and the buttons.

 Pledging openness and regard for public feeling, the new chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission held his first official briefing today, in which he questioned his staff's handling of safety concerns at the nation's oldest nuclear reactor. 
 The chairman, Ivan Selin, who took office July 1, said he was not convinced that his agency was acting properly on the safety of Yankee Rowe, a 30-year-old nuclear power plant in the Berkshire Hills in northwest Massachusetts. 
 The plant has suffered embrittlement of crucial metal parts, but the severity of the problem is unknown. Its owners, a group of New England utilities, plan to conduct inspections and tests in April 1992, when the plant is to be closed for refueling. But a nuclear watchdog group, the Union of Concerned Scientists, has petitioned the commission to close the plant immediately, contending that regulations require that the reactor's safety be demonstrated or that it be shut. 
 In a three-hour session today, Mr. Selin asked the commission staff and the company that operates Yankee Rowe, the Yankee Atomic Electric Company, ""If it's not prudent to go beyond April, why is it prudent to go until April?"" 
 Mr. Selin also questioned the justification offered by his staff for letting the uncertainty continue: that the chance of an accident in the next nine months that would put the brittle parts under stress was small. In remarks to reporters, he likened this rationale to being in a hurry to get home and speeding because the chance of being caught by a police officer was low. 
 ""If you do that every time you go home, sooner or later, you're going to get caught,"" he said. He added that if he thought the plant was unsafe, he would move to close it immediately. 
 But he said he was questioning the commission staff about its handling of the plant ""to make sure we have a process which really does look after the interests of all the American people; the taxpayers, the ratepayers, people who live in the neighborhood or anyplace else. I'm not convinced we have that process on Rowe.""  Tests Are Voluntary 
 Officials of Yankee Atomic Electric are adamant that safety margins at the plant are ample. They say they were performing the tests in April on a voluntary basis. 
 At issue is whether the reactor's protective concrete and metal dome, or vessel, which is about 10 feet wide, 33 feet high and 8 inches thick, could crack during the stresses caused in an accident in which the emergency cooling system is employed. 
 Andrew Kadak, president of Yankee Atomic Electric, said that several special design features and proceedures at the plant helped protect the vessel against damage from the emergency cooling system. 
 He added that cracking would not occur without a pre-existing flaw in the vessel, and that although the vessel had endured three decades of neutron bombardment, ""irradiation by itself does not produce flaws.""  Unkown Factors 
 But the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission disagreed with the utility over how far the embrittlement has progressed. Staff officials said that the amount of deterioration depends on factors that are not precisely known. 
 Test pieces of metal that were placed around the core of the Yankee Rowe reactor to determine the rate of embrittlement from neutron bombardment have either been used or lost. 
 The commission staff reached the conclusion that operating the plant until April should be permitted because its calculation of the reactor's state of embrittlement includes many worst-case assumptions and because the chance of an accident that would test the vessel is about 1 in 1,000. 
 But the Union of Concerned Scientists argued that in previous cases, the commission had found that that level of risk was sufficient to require new safety measures. Robert Pollard, a safety expert with the union and a former member of the commission staff, also cited regulations that call for testing or closing a reactor that had deteriorated to the level of Yankee Rowe. The staff insisted, however, that the scientists union was citing a regulation that did not apply. 
 After the briefing, Mr. Selin said the commission would vote on whether to close the plant after public hearings."

 Every fall as the evenings grow cooler, the eerie spectacle is repeated. From a branch high in the trees of the Great Swamp Outdoor Education Center, it is truly a strange sight. Nearly three dozen two-legged creatures enter the woods wearing insect repellent. As if driven by a primal urge, they tiptoe single file through the brush in the dark of the autumn night, breaking sticks, crunching leaves and otherwise noisily announcing their awkward presence. Every few minutes they stop. They say, ""Shhh."" They wait for the Newark-bound jet to whine over. And then they play a tape of different owls calling. 
 At the slightest sound in the woods, the eyes of these creatures suddenly light up. Their powerful beams of light pierce the darkness, moving from branch to branch. Soon, their eyes close and they move on, crunching more leaves and sticks and muttering, ""Shhh."" 
 It is a timeless story of wonder and terror, no doubt passed down by word of beak from generation to generation of wild residents in this dense wildlife refuge surrounded by even denser cities. On dark nights when the humans honk their horns on nearby streets, feathered fathers surely tell gaggles of rapt raptors the Tale of the Wingless Humans. 
 There is, of course, a simple explanation for this seasonal phenomenon. A few people in the nation's most heavily urbanized state are trying to touch, if only visually, a piece of nature that survives amid all the walls and wires and fumes. But unlike other autumn trompings, this is a benign hunt. 
 ""I've never seen an owl in all my years,"" whispered Grace Scully, who had driven a half-hour from Lincoln Park on the off chance that one of those nocturnal, myth-laden birds would acknowledge her presence with a hoot. 
 ""I've never been for a walk in the woods in the dark,"" said Carolyn Simons, who grew up on Broad Street in Bloomfield where the wildest thing she ever heard at night was a big truck changing gears. Sometimes the vehicle's lights flashed through her bedroom window, throwing strange shadows on the walls. 
 Sue Marchand loves such eager students. She's a naturalist for the Morris County Parks Commission. But whether tracking voles on fresh-fallen snow, shattering misconceptions about wildlife or listening for songbirds in the last promising moments before dawn, Ms. Marchand is really an interpreter. She translates the countryside for city dwellers, who do come up with original questions: What do cardinals mate with? 
 ""My main goal,"" said Ms. Marchand, ""is to teach people to be gentle with the wild and its residents. Leave them alone. Don't chase them with baseball bats. They are more afraid of you than you are of them."" 
 Some frequent messages: Bats are not bad -- they can eat 600 mosquitoes an hour. Don't worry, the swamp's two surviving bears are vegetarians. Hawks don't steal baby humans. Birds don't abandon their young -- they leave to find food or avoid you. Vultures don't eat living things -- they're nature's garbagemen. 
 The subject this evening was New Jersey's owls. ""They're not bad luck,"" said Ms. Marchand. ""They can't turn their heads all around. They're not evil because they're only out at night."" She described their diet (six mice a night). She told why they're so light (hollow bones). She pointed out their dish-shaped faces and ears seemingly out of kilter, which help channel and trace sounds. And she destroyed numerous claims of hearing owls in the morning; those soft hoots are really mourning doves. 
 She played owl tapes: the great horned owl that sounds like a distant dog barking, the barn owl's rhythmic hoot-hoot and the Saw-whet owl's persistent peeps. ""Just remember,"" she told the city dwellers, ""that owl sounds like a garbage truck backing up."" 
 She also described owls' keen listening ability: ""On a branch 40 feet high, they can hear a mouse crawling beneath seven inches of snow."" Which may explain why these fine-feathered hunters chose silence at the approach of a herd of humans ""Shhh-ing"" their way through the woods. Although someone on high did bestow a large gift of white goo on the path just ahead of Ms. Marchand. 
 ""We have more planes than owls tonight,"" she apologized in one dark clearing. But no one seemed to mind, even 10-year-old Donny Spidell, who has been ""into"" owls ever since a screech owl moved in near his bedroom. 
 ""I love this job,"" said Ms. Marchand. ""I love seeing kids open to new things. Some days it's disturbing to hear them calmly talk about the city streets and then be afraid of a raccoon. But some days you feel you've perhaps planted a seed of respect for the other things that live on our Earth."""
"127","Public & Private; The Right Questions",484264,"|opinion",2,11,1991,"19911102T000000",NA," 
 From the public address system of the number 1 train came the voice of civility. ""Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,"" said the voice, ""and welcome to the Broadway local. I don't know whether you're interested in this sort of thing or not, but the number 2 and 3 trains may be boarded just across the platform. In fact, downtown transfers are on the house. Our final destination is South Ferry. This involves closing the doors."" The woman to my left snapped out of her commuter fugue state and laughed. 
 A soothing voice of civility on the subway -- it was wonderful. And weird. Just a few stops south, four men were on trial, charged with another sort of subway story, the one that included the brutal murder of a tourist from Utah a year ago. The voice of civility continued to come over the P.A., faintly British, so at odds with the usual sullen crackle of the speakers. But it was difficult not to think of blood on the station floor.  This is what it is like to be a New Yorker, to have to stop and constantly acknowledge pain. 
 Sometime in the coming week Mario Cuomo may decide whether he is running for President or not. The entire business of Presidential politics, so fitful and ill favored this time around, has ground to a screeching halt, waiting for Mario. If he Godots, if he never arrives on the stump, he will become somehow irrelevant in that way politicians become irrelevant when their time for the Presidency has passed, irrelevant in the way George McGovern and Teddy Kennedy are irrelevant. 
 This would be a waste. Mr. Cuomo has many liabilities, among them the fact that he is a son of the city that much of America thinks of as Depravity 'R' Us. This could be one of his great advantages. Pain 'R' Us, too. Mario Cuomo, the orator, the grocer's son, would be good at acknowledging pain, at asking feelingly, ""Are you better off than you were four years ago?"" 
 The voice on the national public address system says the economy is improving, but almost 1 in 10 Americans are relying on food stamps, a record number. When the President refused, between boating and golf at Kennebunkport in August, to declare the budget emergency that would have extended unemployment benefits, it seemed clear that he doesn't have a clue about what it's like living in America, the America without the rambling family vacation home. His fellow Americans were taking vacations in the above-ground pool bought with the '86 bonus, seeing chlorine as a luxury item. One sad story of depleted savings and downsized hopes after another -- that's what's happening outside the inner circle of the silver spoons. 
 There's a lot of talk going round about how Mr. Cuomo will face difficulties if he runs. He will have to answer for the budget deficits and cuts here in New York State, for his stands on capital punishment and abortion. He will say that the economy is in a mess, instead of trying to pretend that things are improving. He will not run from his unpopular positions, unlike George Bush, who tailored his stand on abortion to suit the prevailing winds. 
 The Governor will evoke, not deny, the fact that we have become a people who anticipate downward mobility for our children. That fear is a turning point in the American psyche.  Some Republicans are gleeful about the ascendancy of Mr. Cuomo, the urban ethnic with the vocabulary of a theologian and the face of a mournful hound. The glee is premature. No one could better suggest that the two highest elected officials in this country are men who believe privilege is a christening gift. 
 Mr. Cuomo may be vulnerable to attack on everything from his ethnicity (now we may see how the Republicans really feel about our tired, our poor, our Italian-Americans) to New York's economy. 
 But let's not look at his vulnerability in a vacuum; let's not pretend he would be challenging Abe Lincoln.  Clarence Thomas. Family leave.  John Sununu. Unemployment benefits. Willie Horton. The gulf war. Iran-contra. Above all, the economy. The soothing voice is seductive, especially when things are as bad as they are today. But in George Bush's case, it is the voice of a man who knows no more about hard times than he does about hard questions. This election should encompass both. The President has plenty to answer for if only the right person asks. The right person is Mario Cuomo."
"128","Earnings Decline in Quarter At Several Large Retailers",486626,"|business",13,11,1991,"19911113T000000",NA," 
 The J. C. Penney Company, the Limited Inc. and Nordstrom Inc. said yesterday that their earnings for the third quarter fell from depressed levels of a year earlier, while the May Department Stores Company said its profits edged up 1 percent. 
 Another retailer, the Caldor Corporation, said its third-quarter loss narrowed from the corresponding period last year. The improvement reflected the company's stock sale, the proceeds of which were used to retire debt. 
 The results provided further evidence of the consumer spending slump that has sliced into the earnings of many retailers. A predicted rebound in spending has not happened, as consumers are weighed down by concerns about the economy and their jobs. 
 Penney, Nordstrom and May also reported earnings declines in 1990 quarter, in the early months of the Persian Gulf war and the recession. The Limited's results were little changed during the period. 
 Following are details of the retailers' results. Penney 
 The Dallas-based Penney said its profits fell by 13.4 percent, to $116 million, or 93 cents a share, compared with $134 million, or $1.07 a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Its revenues fell slightly, to $4.20 billion from $4.24 billion. 
 The retailer attributed its results to a sales drop. The consumer spending drought has taken a heavy toll on Penney. 
 In the third quarter of last year, Penney's earnings plunged nearly 36 percent. The company's shares rose $1.875 yesterday, to $52, on the New York Stock Exchange. Limited 
 The nation's largest specialty apparel retailer said its earnings for the quarter that ended on Nov. 2 fell by 14 percent, to $72.8 million, or 20 cents a share, from $84.9 million, or 23 cents a share. Its sales rose by 15 percent, to $1.43 billion from $1.24 billion. 
 Leslie H. Wexner, the chairman, cited the weak economy and slow store traffic in the quarter. But he said, ""External factors are not an excuse for such mediocre performance."" 
 ""I believe it is always our merchandising that produces success or failure,"" he said. 
 The stock of the Limited, which is based in Columbus, Ohio, rose 75 cents yesterday, to $26.75, on the Big Board. Nordstrom 
 Nordstrom, based in Seattle, said its earnings fell by 4.9 percent, to $19.4 million, or 24 cents a share, in the quarter that ended on Oct. 31. That compared with $20.4 million, or 25 cents a share, in the 1990 quarter, when earnings fell by 7 percent. 
 Its sales rose by 8.2 percent, to $687 million from $634.8 million. 
 Nordstrom said its sales growth rate slowed during the quarter after improving in the first half of its fiscal year. The trend reflected the slowdown in consumer spending. 
 The company's stock rose 62.5 cents yesterday, to $39.125, in over-the-counter trading. May Department Stores 
 May Department Stores, based in St. Louis, said it earned $91 million, or 70 cents a share, in the quarter that ended on Nov. 2, up slightly from $90 million, or 69 cents a share. Its revenues rose by 8 percent, to $2.56 billion from $2.37 billion. 
 Department stores have been particularly hard-hit by the slide in consumer spending. May's stores include Lord & Taylor, May and Hecht's. It also owns the Payless Shoesource chain. 
 May, whose stock rose 62.5 cents yesterday on the Big Board, to $51.875, said it was merging its Thalhimer Brothers division with its Hecht's operation. 
 The move will close seven Thalhimer's stores in Virginia and North Carolina.  Caldor 
 Caldor, the discount-store chain based in Norwalk, Conn., reported a $3.8 million loss, compared with a loss of $5.7 million, before adjustments and other items, in the 1990 period. The company's sales rose by 4.5 percent, to $417.8 million from $399.8 million. 
 The retailer, which returned to public ownership earlier this year after a leveraged buyout, is still paying down the costs of the transaction. 
 Caldor's stock rose 37.5 cents on the Big Board yesterday, to $14.625.

"130","As Slovak Separatism Gains, Havel Faces the Unthinkable",488221,"|world|front page",20,11,1991,"19911120T000000","|CZECHOSLOVAKIA"," 
 Two years after the ""velvet revolution"" that he led, President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia is struggling to preserve the unity of his country against Slovak separatist strivings. 
 The possibility of a breakup of Czechoslovakia, founded in 1918 after the demise of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, seemed unthinkable when Mr. Havel came to power late in December 1989. Now, though, the unthinkable occupies the top of the President's agenda, and he is considering the worst. 
 ""I have said many times that I am a supporter of a common state,"" Mr. Havel said in an interview last week. ""But if life together in one state is not possible, I favor a constitutional separation."" 
 The Czechoslovak leader rejected a comparison with the warring republics of Yugoslavia, where separatism has led to warfare. ""I think it is very improbable that our dispute could lead to violent conflict,"" Mr. Havel said. ""It is not in our tradition. We have never been at war against each other.""  An Office in Slovakia 
 Significantly, the interview did not take place in Prague, the national and Czech capital, but here in the Slovak capital. Hoping to take the sting out of complaints that, as a Czech, he does not give full recognition to Slovak equality, Mr. Havel has established a presidential office in Bratislava Castle and last week conducted the nation's affairs from there. 
 The Czechoslovak leader has been the target of Slovak separatists more than once since he took office. The most recent incident occurred during his last visit here on Oct. 28, the Czechoslovak national day, when Mr. Havel was prevented from speaking in the main square by an egg-throwing, jeering crowd of Slovak separatists. 
 Many in the crowd were identified as regular participants in unruly street demonstrations, including a daylong siege of Parliament organized by the Slovak National Party, a separatist group that received 14 percent of the vote in parliamentary elections in June 1990. 
 The President advocated a new constitutional arrangement that would give the Czech and Slovak republics full equality in the federal state. He said Czechoslovakia's international prestige, regained since the ouster of the Communist leadership in December 1989, depended on it. 
 However, a two-day meeting by the legislative leaders of both republics, which had been expected to adopt a basis for new constitutional structures aimed at political equality, ended in failure last Tuesday. This, together with a subsequent effort to push a sovereignty resolution through the Slovak Parliament, so far inconclusive, has made the President grim and his senior advisers gloomy. 
 ""This is the beginning of the end,"" a Slovak aide to Mr. Havel said. After that failure, the national Parliament declined to heed the President's urging to call a national referendum on the question. The President and his advisers believe that a majority of Czechs and Slovaks continue to favor a single country and want a referendum to go over the heads of the Slovak political establishment.  Havel Wants Referendum 
 In a television address on Sunday night, Mr. Havel proposed a package of constitutional measures that would give him the right to order a referendum without Parliament's approval and to call a referendum when 20 percent of the voters in either republic petition for it. 
 He urged citizens to demand that their legislators approve the measures, which he said represented ""the only way of overcoming the threat of a deep constitutional crisis."" 
 Slovak supporters of a single Czechoslovakia are speaking in earnest of ""emigration"" to the Czech republic, and owners of new and private small businesses said they had transferred their accounts to Czech banks. 
 Those who oppose a separate Slovak state said in many interviews during two trips through this republic of 5 million that they believed that only through a continued union with Prague would their newly restored democracy be assured of surviving. 
 The only supposedly independent Slovak state in history was created by Hitler when he dismantled Czechoslovakia following the Munich agreement. It became a satellite of Nazi Germany, participating in the war against the Allies until it was reincorporarted into Czechoslovakia in 1945.  In Shadow of Czechs 
 Mr. Havel said he was sympathetic to the strong need of Slovaks for ""a sense of self-fulfillment."" He added, ""During the entire existence of this republic, the Slovak nation has lived in the shadow of the Czech nation."" 
 The President's supporters in Slovakia cite historic factors that have contributed to the tension between the Czechs and Slovaks. 
 The Czech lands, which consist of Bohemia, Moravia and a part of Silesia and have 10 million people, have a long past as national entities. They shared in the intellectual life of the Renaissance and Enlightenment. They were ruled from Vienna, whose hand, though far from liberal, was lighter than that of Hungary, which did not regard the lands now called Slovakia as anything but an integral part of that country. 
 The Czech lands constituted the industrial heartland of the empire; Slovakia was left largely agricultural. 
 Until 1918, there were no schools that taught in Slovak, a language close to Czech. Most education was in Hungarian, with some in German. ""There were many Czech teachers who came here after 1918 to teach us Slovak,"" said Mariana Hrabinska, a reporter in Banska Bystrica, a central Slovak town. 
 Advocates of the federated system agree that national governments in Prague since 1918 have failed to take actions necessary to equalize the two regions and give Slovaks a sense of equal standing. But they do not believe that breaking up the country will improve the lives of Slovaks. 
 They note a drastic reduction since the 1990 voting of open support for the federal state. Public Against Violence, the pro-Havel civic movement that won a 30-percent plurality, was split by a former Slovak Premier, Vladimir Meciar. The party he formed is now the largest and its policies are increasingly separatist, and Mr. Meciar is now the most popular political figure after Mr. Havel in opinion polls. 
 Jan Carnogursky, the present Slovak Premier, is also a former Havel supporter. He is now the leader of the Christian Democrats, the second-largest party, and gives only qualified support to a federal state. In an interview, he said Czechoslovakia should cease to exist when it is admitted into the European Community. It should enter as two states, he said, as the common country will have lost its reason for being. 
 Havel supporters take what optimism they can from the fact that Slovak separatism is greatest here in Bratislava and in central Slovakia, while the large region of the east, around Kosice, Slovakia's second city, has traditionally looked to Prague rather than Bratislava. 
 But in Kosice, pro-Havel leaders, while confirming that there was little support for the separatists, spoke gloomily of political passivity and growing resentment of Prague because of a rapid rise in unemployment. Heavy industries, created by the Communists largely to produce exportable goods to the Soviet Union, face a catastrophic shrinkage of markets. 
 A visit to the area by Mr. Havel Thursday and Friday cheered the President -- he encountered no jeers -- but it also gave credence to the local leaders' views of voter passivity and the President's decline in poularity.  Mr. Havel was met by warm but small crowds, and most of the 260,000 people of Kosice showed little interest. 
 Mr. Havel believes that only ""a quick and civilized"" solution of the Slovak problem can bring economic recovery. 
 ""If we don't so this"" Mr. Havel said, ""we can hardly expect any foreign assistance. Everybody is waiting for this, everybody is hesitating because of our unstable domestic situation. This is the first requirement for everything. 
 ""The most important task is to maintain such respect as we have gained in the world by resolving our domestic problem,"" he said. ""If we fail, we lose this respect."""
"131","On My Mind; Just One Prisoner",493726,"|opinion",13,12,1991,"19911213T000000","|MIDDLE EAST|LEBANON|ISRAEL"," 
 In the Middle East, families of hostages swallowed by dark and silence do not put out yellow ribbons; it is not their way. But they remember their men every day as achingly as do Westerners, hope as passionately for signs of life from them, mourn as deeply when hope is gone. 
 In Israel, a whole country longs for word of Capt. Ron Arad, taken prisoner in October 1986. Israeli officials believe there is a chance he is alive. 
 If he is dead, murdered since he was last heard from four years ago, they want his remains returned so that he can be buried in his faith and so that his family can at least grieve fully, in knowledge of his fate. 
 Israeli diplomats are trying to seize what they fear may be the last opportunity to discover what happened to Captain Arad and to rescue him if he still breathes. They think the opening may last only a couple of weeks more. 
 In 1986 Captain Arad was a navigator. He was 28 years old. His wife, Tami, is now 30 and they have a 6-year-old daughter. 
 His plane was shot down in Lebanon and he was captured near the Syrian border by members of a Lebanese group called Amal. At that point he was a prisoner of war, covered by international conventions under which he was supposed to be treated decently, allowed to see official observers and to have some contact with his country and family. 
 In the Middle East, to talk of that kind of thing is black comedy. An Amal defector turned the captain over to the Iranian-sponsored Lebanese hostage-takers, the Party of God, which in turn handed him over directly to the Iranians -- the Iranian Revolutionary Guard detachment in Lebanon. About $300,000 was paid for Captain Arad by the Party of God, which gets its money from Iran. 
 Mrs. Arad received one letter from him in 1987. She says she does not know its route. The Iranians claim to know nothing. But in Teheran President Rafsanjani did declare recently that he could not say he knew Captain Arad was dead -- a comment the Israelis take as a reed. 
 Now Uri Lubrani, who was Israel's chief representative during the intricacies of persuading Iran to order the release of Western hostages, feels time is closing in. 
 The term of Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who was so central to the hostage negotiations, expires at the end of this year. When he goes, so will the expertise he has acquired in the infinitely delicate specialty of handling kidnapper-nations and victim-nations simultaneously. So, presumably, will Giandomenico Picco, his personal envoy, a soldier of diplomacy. 
 The Israelis hope these two men can be important to the Arad case. The Secretary General has agreed to send Mr. Picco back to Teheran for one more try at the case -- and getting the remains of two or three Israeli soldiers probably dead. 
 Israeli officials also have seen key people in Washington, urging that any arrangements made with Iran be made contingent on getting at the truth about Captain Arad. For this the Israelis are ready to release their most important captive, Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, the Lebanese Shiite cleric, and all remaining Lebanese prisoners in Israeli hands, about 220 of them. 
 The United States says it did not negotiate with the kidnappers. It did not have to, with the Secretary General and the Israelis handling the job. 
 To help free the Western hostages, the Israelis released about 90 prisoners on an agreed schedule. When the hostages were released, American thanks went to Iran and Syria. 
 Israelis had hoped not for thanks as reward but the truth about Captain Arad. They did not get it and are looking for help, quietly but without diplomatic pretenses, from the Secretary General, from Washington and from at least one American journalist. 
 In five years of writing this column I have dealt often with the Middle East, Israel and Arab-Israeli struggles. Never had an Israeli official asked me to write or withhold anything or support an Israeli cause. 
 A couple of days ago an Israeli official did come to me to ask me to write about Captain Arad. He hoped that a column now would properly point out the importance of what the Secretary General is doing as his term runs out. And he thought perhaps it might be put before President Bush, this story of one more prisoner and the invisible yellow ribbon worn by a whole country."

 ""We're dealing with a mockery and praying for a miracle,"" Mr. Sharpton said from the steps of the courthouse in Hackensack, where lawyers are to make closing arguments in the trial on Monday. ""We're staying in the streets until Spath pays for killing Phillip Pannell."" 
 Officer Spath, who is white, is being tried for manslaughter for shooting Mr. Pannell, a 16-year-old black, in the back in April 1990. He contends he fired in self-defense during a chase because the teen-ager had reached into his jacket pocket, where a crude loaded handgun was later found. 
 Before the three-mile march, which was orderly, Mr. Sharpton said he was upset by several factors in the trial, including an all-white jury, two jurors with relatives who are former or present police officers, the arrest of a prosecution witness by sheriff's detectives on an old probation charge moments after he testified and the appearance of Steven McDonald, a New York City policeman paralyzed by a teen-aged gunman in 1986.

He became infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, in 1982 at John Hopkins University Hospital when a test tube with contaminated blood broke in his hand, piercing a thumb. He was diagnosed as having AIDS in 1986. 
 Dr. Aoun sued the hospital, saying hospital officials refused to support him and dismissed him from his hospital job. University officials said they offered him a faculty position and other benefits before he brought his suit. The lawsuit was settled out of court in 1988. Opposed Mandatory Testing 
 A cardiologist educated at the University of Costa Rica and Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Dr. Aoun was a chief resident of medicine at the time of the accident. Even as his health faltered, he became a strong voice on behalf of health-care workers, opposing mandatory testing of health-care workers for H.I.V. because of likely discrimination against those infected. He also exhorted interns and residents to insure that they had benefits to protect themselves in the event they contracted an illness on the job. 
 ""They ask you to go be on the front lines in medicine, saying you have a moral and ethical duty to do it, and you go willingly,"" he told The New York Times in March 1990. ""But if something happens, you are on your own."" 
 In an article published this month in the Annals of Internal Medicine, he said: ""Medicine must lead the way in changing society's fears and misconceptions about AIDS. If medical people show little compassion or discriminate against the victims of this illness, why should the rest of society know or do better?"" 
 He is survived by his wife, Dr. Patricia Aoun of Glen Arm, and a daughter, Gabriela; his parents, Orlando and Aura Aoun, and two brothers, Orlando and Juan Carlos, all of Caracas, Venezuela."
"134","Medication After Life Support",508542,NA,19,2,1992,"19920219T000000",NA," 
 WHEN hopelessly ill patients are removed or kept from life support, they are often given sedatives and pain-killing drugs but the drugs are given as often to comfort family members as they are to soothe the patient, a new study suggests. In a third of the cases, the study found, the aim was also to speed the patient's death. 
 ""We were not surprised that the physicians and nurses working with these patients would like to allow the patient to peacefully depart once it's been decided that further medical therapy would be of no benefit,"" said Dr. William Wilson, a resident at the University of California at San Diego and one of the authors of the study. 
 ""However,"" he said, ""we were surprised that so many physicians and nurses would tell us that the hastening of death was a reason for use of these drugs, on paper, in a study that was clearly going to be published."" 
 The researchers, whose findings are reported in today's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, interviewed the doctors and nurses who cared for 44 critically ill patients after they had stopped receiving life support. 
 These researchers emphasize, however, that the study and informal discussions later with the doctors and nurses who participated suggest that hastening death was never the sole or even the main reason for the use of the drugs. 
 Most often the drugs were prescribed and administered to alleviate pain and suffering. Surprisingly, the drugs were given nearly as often ""for the comfort"" of the patient's family as they were given to reduce the suffering of the patients themselves. 
 But on this score, doctors who order the drugs differ in their thinking from nurses who actually administer them. In just over half of the cases did doctors order drugs to comfort the family of the dying patient. Yet in more than four out of every five cases, nurses who had discretion in administering drugs said that they were treating the patients for the comfort of their loved ones. 
 Because almost all patients died within a few hours of the withdrawal of life support, the study found little evidence that patients who were receiving drugs to speed their deaths were dying any more quickly than those who did not receive the drugs. 
 ""The most important thing about this study is that it shows that one should not be afraid to provide the sedatives and analgesics required for a patient to be comfortable for fear that in doing so they might hasten the patient's death,"" Dr. Wilson said."
"135","Saudi Rulers Are Confronting Challenge by Islamic Radicals",512702,"|world|front page",9,3,1992,"19920309T000000","|SAUDI ARABIA|IRAQ"," 
 In specialized Islamic cassette shops across this country, a two-hour tape that rails against the Saudi Government has become the latest hit of the subversive Islamic materials making the rounds in Saudi Arabia. 
 ""Royal family princes are not owed allegiance except if they follow the rules of Islam,"" the unidentified speaker declares, opening the tape's assault on the Saudi rulers. The tape goes on to attack the senior religious leaders allied with the monarchy; the United States, which is described as an atheist enemy of Islam, and most of all the growing number of middle- and upper-class Saudis who have turned away from religion and toward a secular, Western-oriented way of life. 'The Supergun' Is the Title 
 The recorded message, called ""The Supergun,"" is perhaps the sharpest illustration of a yearlong confrontation with an increasingly outspoken group of Muslim clergymen who have challenged the ruling establishment of Saudi Arabia. 
 This confrontation is of great importance to the future of a kingdom that sits on the world's largest pool of oil, a kingdom that ranks as the West's most prized ally and friend in the Middle East today. But even though the verbal battle is sharp, the consensus here is that the fundamentalists will not win. 
 After Saudi Arabia emerged relatively unscathed from the Persian Gulf war, its Government decided that it could best insure continued prosperity by looking outward, modernizing the nation's laws and expanding personal and institutional freedoms. This change from a tradition of conservativism in foreign and domestic policies has brought a backlash from radical clergymen and their young followers. 
 The fundamentalists' campaign is actively opposed by many of the secular Saudis, who are continuing to demand more liberalization. In the middle stands the one power that has for 60 years been the arbiter of consensus here -- the House of Saud, which is headed by King Fahd. 
 Until a year ago, the Saudi Government largely ignored the religious radicalism, considering it a minor problem. Today it appears to be moving swiftly to contain it by calling on traditional religious leaders to rein in the radicals, and by calling fundamentalist leaders in for questioning and depriving them of their pulpits in mosques. 
 But it appears that the House of Saud has decided that its security and the welfare of the nation lie in forging ahead with modernization despite the protests. 
 Officials here say the new Consultative Council announced by King Fahd last Sunday will expand public participation in government. The council's 60 members, who will be chosen by the King over the next six months, are expected to be figures from academia, business and the friendly religious elite, not the fundamentalists who are challenging the Government's modernizing trend. 
 Ignoring fundamentalist objections, the council is expected to reinforce policies favoring banks and business ventures with Western industries, vastly expanding the margin of operations for a booming private sector. 
 ""There is no self-doubt here,"" a senior diplomat said of the Government's policy. 
 To oppose it, the fundamentalists have only their invective, but it is not an insignificant weapon when circulated on mass-produced recordings that are distributed free of charge on streetcorners or at nominal cost at the Islamic shops. These are small storefront operations, invariably full of bearded men, that sell inspirational recordings and literature and such trinkets as jigsaw puzzles of the shrines at Mecca. Corruption Is Attacked 
 ""The Supergun,"" named after the Iraqi project to build an artillery piece with a range of hundreds of miles, zeroes in on corruption, mismanagement and theft of the public treasury as the main problems of the country. 
 ""The personal behavior of some of our rulers is so scandalous that it is the subject of books and articles abroad which are damaging our reputation,"" it says. 
 ""Look at how senior officials and ministers have stayed in their jobs for decades, as if this nation is devoid of qualified men,"" the speaker says. ""Look at their friendship with atheist nations which they consult in all affairs as their Information Ministry bans any newspaper or magazine that attacks America."" 
 Another tape, popular for more than two years, is ""America As I Saw It,"" by a well-known preacher named Ayid al-Qorni. The hourlong tape describes the United States as a thoroughly atheistic nation in which men marry other men, where sons and daughters abandon their parents to hunger and old age, where women have fatherless children, where movies ""show animals fornicating with humans."" 'A Nation of Beasts' 
 He complains that exercisers jog in the streets ""practically naked like animals"" and that women look at men straight in the eye ""without shame and without veil to cover them."" He says America is in decline because it is a ""nation of beasts who fornicate and eat rotten food,"" adding that he prays to God to destroy the United States ""the same way he destroyed Russia."" 
 Tapes like these are avidly consumed by tens of thousands of militant Muslims. But in the judgment of many Saudis and foreign diplomats, the radical fringe is outnumbered. 
 A major reason is that in Saudi Arabia the working class, where anti-establishment sentiment might be expected to take root, is mostly imported from Asia and poor countries of the Middle East. An estimated four million to five million expatriates sweep the streets, pump the oil, drive the cars and build the cities, and they would lose their treasured jobs and visas if they dared to speak out against the authorities. 
 Most Saudis -- 8 million to 11 million -- belong to the middle and upper classes, enjoying a level of comfort that does not tend to breed revolutionary fervor. Even Saudi women, who have reason to be angry with a system that severely restricts their access to jobs, education and property ownership and their freedom to travel, are quiescent. 
 ""Over here conservatives means people who do not want to rock the boat, and that's the great majority of the Saudis,"" said a diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""The House of Saud may have termites, but it is not too late to call in exterminators."" A Saudi Sea Change 
 Saudis and foreign diplomats here say that what underlies this judgment is a sea change that has taken place here over the last 18 months, a product of Saudi Arabia's unprecedented opening to the West after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, and of an oil boom, now in its 19th year, that has finally tipped the balance of Saudi society to people with money, education and a Western orientation. 
 Liberal, educated Saudis constitute virtually the entire middle class, but also a substantial number of the estimated 6,000 to 7,000 in the Saudi royal family, and it is these people who have been accommodated by the Government's initiatives since the gulf crisis. 
 ""What was before the war cannot be after it,"" said a prince who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""These reforms are viewed as a safety valve."" 
 In foreign policy, the Saudi leaders proudly proclaim their alliance with the West, ignoring the fundamentalists' condemnations of Westerners as the ""new Crusaders fighting Islam."" The Government has strongly supported the Middle East peace talks, which began in October. Prominent American Jews have publicly visited the country, visits that not long ago would have been unthinkable. Council to Review Laws 
 On the domestic front, the new Consultative Council is to serve at the King's pleasure, and bears no resemblance to a Western-style democratic body. But it is supposed to review laws and Government policies and is empowered to recommend that the King reject those that are found lacking. The council will give a powerful new forum to the Westernized, pro-business establishment, which is expected to provide most of its membership. 
 The middle-class endorsement of these bold steps can be measured by the boom in the Saudi stock market, the return here of an estimated $20 billion to $30 billion in capital that had fled to the West during the gulf crisis, a record-breaking expansion of investment in the Saudi private sector and brisk business at banks. That has occurred despite constant warnings from fundamentalists against loan interest, which some Islamic authorities say is forbidden by the Koran. 
 The new Consultative Council is in part a recognition that many Saudi business executives and administrators have surpassed the pool of royal family princes in prominence in the public and private sectors. It also symbolically makes room for the hundreds of thousands of educated Saudis who, benefiting from the oil bonanza of the last two decades, have emerged from schools to claim a place in society. 
 With the end of the princes' monopoly over decision-making, it is clear that the ancient structure of Saudi society, which is based on tribal and paternalistic systems of government and has sustained the country since its founding 60 years ago, is changing. 
 ""There are so many royal family princes now, something like 7,000 or so, that even within the royal family itself there is a hierarchy and a meritocracy system,"" a senior Arab diplomat said. ""You really have to do something particularly brilliant to be noticed."" 
 The new Government policies were also influenced by a falling-out with foreign-based fundamentalist movements like the Islamic Salvation Front of Algeria, the Nahda movement in Tunisia and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Sudan, Jordan and Syria. These movements, once thought to be friends of Saudi Arabia, proved during the gulf crisis to be determined enemies, siding with Iraq and calling for the downfall of the Saudi royal family. New Crop of Preachers 
 Across the country over the last year and before that, a crop of Muslim preachers in religious universities who are in their 30's and 40's emerged to oppose the recent modernizing trends. These militants, who number in the tens of thousands, are the product of a previous policy by the Government on the idea that more religious education is better. The Government used to seek the support of its own religious establishment to resist Iran's radical clergy and Iraq's secularist revolutionary ideology. 
 The result was a vast crop of people whose religious training is unsuited to a dynamic economy that requires knowledge of foreign languages, business administration and technical skills to move forward. 
 But the end of the gulf crisis in 1991 and the end of the war between Iraq and Iran in 1988 have diminished the Saudi Government's fear of these two regional powers, making the support of the fundamentalists expendable. 
 ""The importance of these new laws,"" commented Turki al-Hamad, a professor of political science in King Saud University in Riyadh, who has often been attacked in speeches by religious militants as a secularist, ""lies in the fact that they block the way to any auctioneering and betting over the Islamization of politics and the society."" Interviewed in the Saudi daily Asharq Al Awsat, Mr. Hamad said they set ""clear Islamic parameters in constitutional terms."" Joint Ventures With West 
 Given its immense oil reserves and major strides in consumer industries and finance, Government officials say it is now clear that Saudi Arabia's future lies in joint ventures with Western economies, which are multiplying. 
 Moreover, the security of Saudi Arabia, as has been amply demonstrated in the gulf crisis, is intimately tied to a commitment by the West to defend it, leaving little choice but to further reinforce ties with the West. 
 To reach these goals, the ruling establishment has clearly decided that if it has to take sides in the internal debate, it must side with the liberals whose political agenda is focused on rewriting the social convenent to emphasize greater freedoms and more democratization. 
 ""The religious establishment is sure that any changes toward the orbit of modernity will be at their expense, which means the lines of battle are drawn,"" said a top Arab diplomat from the gulf who lives here."

"138","Television Notes; NBC Tries Again With a News-Magazine Format",517918,NA,31,3,1992,"19920331T000000",NA," 
 Although ABC and CBS have seen their faith in the news-magazine format rewarded with long-running programs that generate substantial ratings and profits, NBC's efforts to produce a successful news magazine have resulted in television's longest-running exercise in futility. 
 Since NBC initially attempted a news-magazine format with ""First Tuesday"" in 1969, the entries have included such quickly obsolete names as ""Weekend,"" ""NBC Magazine,"" ""1986,"" ""Prime-Time Sunday"" and ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow."" 
 But after its last efforts -- ""Real Life With Jane Pauley"" and ""Expose"" -- were pulled from the air last year, NBC decided it was time to get truly serious about finding a news magazine that could do for NBC what ""60 Minutes"" had done for CBS and ""20/20"" for ABC. 
 So tonight at 10, the network is trying again, with ""Dateline NBC,"" a program that combines some of the elements from those last two attempts -- including one of its anchors, Jane Pauley (the other is Stone Phillips) -- and that brings in the kind of staff and production expertise the network says it has never had on a news-magazine program. 
 Michael G. Gartner, the president of NBC, expressing confidence in the program, cited the money and resources that have been dedicated to ""Dateline NBC,"" but freely admitted the most important factor in his positive feeling was the commitment the new program has received from the network management. 
 For the first time, an NBC news magazine has the unreserved backing of the network, represented by a promise from NBC's president, Robert C. Wright, that the show will have at least 52 weeks on the air to find an audience and, most crucially, by the fact that it has been given the best possible time period. 
 Previous news-magazine programs have demonstrated that there is a strong appetite for news programs on week nights at 10. ABC's ""20/20"" has flourished at that hour on Fridays. CBS's ""48 Hours,"" which struggled at 8 P.M., has become a hit at 10 on Wednesdays. And ABC's ""Prime-Time Live,"" after initially falling on its face, has emerged this season as a force at 10 on Thursdays. All three news magazines have improved their ratings this season. 
 That left two week nights open, but Monday night was ruled out because of N.F.L. Football on ABC, dependable movies on NBC and the position of ""Northern Exposure"" on CBS as television's highest-rated drama. 
 Tuesday at 10 was clearly the last ideal spot. 
 ABC has committed itself to a third news magazine in the fall, but that one will be on Sunday nights at 7, against the most powerful competition in television, ""60 Minutes."" 
 News magazines are produced for about two-thirds the cost of an entertainment hour, but their real value lies in the fact that the network owns them and that unlike entertainment shows, they can continue indefinitely. 
 Jeff Diamond, the executive producer of ""Dateline NBC,"" was hired away from a position as senior producer of ""20/20."" He said he twice declined earlier offers to produce an NBC news magazine because ""I just didn't believe there was any real commitment."" 
 ""Dateline NBC"" is making no claims about reinventing the news-magazine format. Indeed, it will do pretty much what the others do: three stories a week. ""The key is always the storytelling,"" Mr. Diamond said. 
 Like the other successful news magazines, ""Dateline"" will try to land big, news-making interviews, Mr. Diamond said. Back to 'L.A. Law' 
 Though he initially said he was coming back to ""L.A. Law"" only as a more active consultant, Steven Bochco, the leading producer of television drama over the past decade, has resumed a role as executive producer of the NBC series. 
 Mr. Bochco received his first executive producer credit in four years on ""L.A. Law"" last Thursday, sharing that title with Rick Wallace. Jim Gordon, a spokesman for Mr. Bochco, said yesterday that Mr. Bochco would continue to take the executive producer credit for this season's six remaining episodes of ""L.A. Law."" 
 Mr. Bochco left ""L.A. Law"" after he signed an exclusive contract with ABC in 1987. He currently has two shows on ABC, ""Doogie Howser, M.D."" and ""Civil Wars,"" and has begun work on a new drama for ABC for next season, ""N.Y.P.D. Blue."" 
 But when ""L.A. Law"" struggled both in its storytelling and the ratings early this season under a new executive producer, Patricia Green, Mr. Bochco and David E. Kelley, the executive producer who followed Mr. Bochco, agreed to take a more active role in the production. 
 At the time Mr. Bochco was not expected to resume the full hands-on production role on the show. Yesterday Mr. Bochco confessed he had changed his mind, Mr. Gordon said. 
 ""Steven said, 'I'm doing the work; I might as well get the credit,' "" Mr. Gordon said. USA Buys Sci-Fi Channel 
 The USA Network, which has been among the most successful cable networks, will announce today that it has acquired the Sci-Fi Channel, an all-science-fiction programming cable service, which has been struggling in its efforts to establish itself since it was begun in early 1991. 
 The Sci-Fi Channel has been offering programming that its president, Mitchell Rubinstein, identified as science-fiction movies, comic book, fantasy and ""non-violent horror."" It has included such fare as the more than 1,000 episodes of the original daytime serial ""Dark Shadows,"" the old movie serial ""Flash Gordon,"" which starred Buster Crabbe, and compilations of movies featuring such science-fiction stars as Boris Karloff."
"139","Sports of The Times; The Ultimate Yankee Still Shows Class",519850,"|sports",8,4,1992,"19920408T000000",NA," 
 FOR the Yankee opener at Yankee Stadium, the ultimate Yankee would soon be throwing out the ceremonial first ball. And now, in the runway behind the dugout, silver-haired Joe DiMaggio was wearing a blue blazer with a red-and-blue figured tie and a white shirt, dark gray slacks and black winged-tip shoes. At age 77, he projected class and dignity, qualities that the Yankees and all of baseball haven't always projected lately. 
 ""I haven't done this,"" he said, ""since the 1981 World Series."" 
 His longtime friend, Barry Halper, the Yankees' new executive vice president, had asked Joe DiMaggio to throw out the first ball, maybe just as a reminder of what the Yankees once meant. Perhaps coincidentally, the Yankees responded with a 4-3 victory over the rival Red Sox and Roger Clemens, baseball's best pitcher. But the new manager, Buck Showalter, and most of the players were strangers to him. 
 ""I've never met the manager,"" DiMaggio said, ""and there's nobody on this club I know."" 
 But they knew him. So did the fans in the crowd of 56,572, mostly from Old-Timers Days. 
 ""The first Old-Timers Day was 1946,"" he was saying now. ""The Yankees brought in Walter Johnson to pitch to Babe Ruth, just the two of them. Babe swung and fouled it off. He swung again and fouled it off. Finally he hit a foul ball down the right-field line, but he went into his home-run trot anyway. The fans loved it. 
 ""The next year they brought in Carl Hubbell to pitch to the Babe, and Hubbell tried to trick him. Hubbell kept throwing the ball outside, but then Babe hit another foul ball down the right-field line and went into his home-run trot again. The fans loved it. But that was the last time he swung a bat. He died the next year."" 
 Babe Ruth called most people ""kid,"" but when DiMaggio was a rookie in 1936, the Babe, just retired, visited the Yankees in spring training. 
 ""He went around the clubhouse shaking hands,"" DiMaggio once said, ""and when he got to me, he said, 'Hiya, Joe.' I couldn't believe he knew my name."" 
 That name would join the Babe and Lou Gehrig in Yankee history, then it would be joined by Mickey Mantle and Reggie Jackson. 
 Now that name had moved up the concrete steps into the Yankee dugout where only one man in a Yankee uniform yesterday, Coach Russ Meyer, had played against him. Meyer remembered pitching to DiMaggio for the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1950 World Series. 
 ""You flied out to left,"" Meyer said. 
 ""Why didn't you say I hit one, Russ?"" 
 Meyer must have been teasing. In two relief appearances, he never faced the Yankee center fielder. But now, one by one, Showalter and the other Yankees trotted to the first-base line to be introduced and for the 23d consecutive year Robert Merrill was booming the national anthem at the Yankee Stadium opener. By now the ultimate Yankee was holding the ceremonial first ball, and on Merrill's return to the dugout, he smiled. 
 ""I listened to every word,"" he told the opera singer, ""and you got 'em all right."" 
 ""I was going to sing it in Italian for you,"" Merrill said. ""You know the words."" 
 Looking out across the grass, the ultimate Yankee couldn't remember any particular opening days from his career, but he remembered his impression of the first time he saw Yankee Stadium as a rookie. 
 ""The triple tier,"" he said, pointing down the left-field line. ""I never saw Yankee Stadium until I played here."" 
 It was different then. The distances to the fences were much deeper, especially in left-center, the power alley for a right-handed hitter. 
 ""You see where the Getty sign is?"" he said, pointing far beyond the left-field wall. ""That's where the fence was."" 
 Not quite that far. But if the distances to the fences were the same as they are now, Joe DiMaggio would have hit more than 361 home runs. At least 100 more. But by now Buck Showalter had returned to the dugout and Barry Halper introduced him to the ultimate Yankee. 
 ""Thanks for coming today,"" the new manager said, shaking hands. 
 Moments later, DiMaggio hopped to the top of the dugout steps as Bob Sheppard's voice rumbled through the public-address system: 
 ""At the area near the pitcher's mound, baseball's greatest living player will throw out the first ball, Joe DiMaggio."" 
 Despite the arthritic aches in his back and shoulders, the ultimate Yankee glided out into the caldron of cheers he has heard so often. From the grass in front of the mound, he threw the ceremonial ball to Matt Nokes, shook hands with the Yankee catcher, then hurried to the dugout. 
 ""It was painless,"" he said."
"140","Co-Chairmen Attuned to Macy's Needs",524491,"|business",28,4,1992,"19920428T000000",NA," 
 In choosing two men to replace Edward S. Finkelstein, the R. H. Macy board took an unusual step intended to address the competing pressures facing the company. 
 The board gave the titles of co-chairman and co-chief executive to a financier, Myron E. Ullman 3d, and a merchant, Mark S. Handler. While the two men get along well, some management experts question whether such an arrangement can last. 
 Some retailing consultants say they think the move was a stopgap measure aimed at dealing as neatly as possible with Mr. Finkelstein's abrupt departure. Mr. Ullman, a relative newcomer to the tradition-steeped department store company, and Mr. Handler, who has spent more than 30 years at Macy's, are a study in contrasts. But both played down the possibility of conflicts, noting that they had worked together closely for three and a half years.  ""We see it as a long-term and very viable relationship,"" Mr. Handler said. ""We think it's a very viable way to run a company.""  The men will be jointly responsible for developing a Macy business plan, the crucial blueprint subject to approval of the company's creditors and the bankruptcy judge. Mr. Ullman will be responsible for operations and corporate functions and Mr. Handler will be in charge of merchandising and marketing. 
 Mr. Ullman joined Macy's in 1988. As vice chairman and chief operating officer, he has played the leading role in Macy's dealing with its lenders. 
 ""He's a very good leader and a very good financial guy,"" said Mark Solow, a senior executive vice president of Chemical Bank, which played a leading role in arranging financing for Macy's 1986 leveraged buyout, and also in providing loans after it filed for bankruptcy in January. 
 Mr. Solow and others described Mr. Ullman as straightforward, bright and extremely focused. ""He knows what's important and what's not,"" Mr. Solow said. Tall Order in Cincinnati 
 Mr. Ullman, who is 45 years old, was selected by President Ronald Reagan as a White House Fellow, a coveted position that exposes prominent young Americans to the workings of the Federal Government. 
 Guiding Macy's in bankruptcy is not Mr. Ullman's first experience with a financially troubled organization. As the 30-year-old chief financial officer at the University of Cincinnati, he brought order to an organization struggling to meet its budget. ""He really put the entire university financial system in place for me,"" said Warren Bennis, a former president of the university who is now a business professor at the University of Southern California. 
 Still, as an author of several books on leadership, Mr. Bennis said that the division of power at Macy was unlikely to last. ""It can work, but it usually doesn't last that long,"" he said. He added that if anybody could make such an arrangement work, Mr. Ullman could. 
 Management experts said such arrangements usually ran into problems because of turf battles and personality conflicts. For such divisions of authority to work, they say, it is important that each executive's responsibilities be clearly defined. 
 Walter Levy, a retail consultant, said the tandem appointment was likely an interim step. But he noted that large retail companies often divide up operations and management. 
 Mr. Handler, who is 59, has spent his career at Macy, joining the company's training program in 1958. He rose through the ranks with stops as a fabrics buyer and as chief executive of the Bamberger's subsidiary. Since 1980, Mr. Handler has been president and chief operating officer of R. H. Macy & Company."

 There is no difference in the way a hurricane destroys a rich person's home and a poor person's home. Unfortunately in this country there is still a big difference in the opportunities each will have to rebuild that home and a stable life. 
 The second tragedy of Hurricane Andrew is that when the emergency is over and the long-term recovery gets under way, many of those who lost their homes so swiftly, those with no insurance, no savings and no health care, will find themselves abandoned by a system that provides little opportunity to re-enter the mainstream. 
 These people will suddenly face a reality well known to millions of other low-income Americans, a reality in which years of inattention to long-term solutions has made it nearly impossible for the poorest sector of society to attain basic necessities such as affordable housing, social services and health care, especially during a crisis. 
 Emergency relief is essential but will go only so far toward rebuilding lives. After that, people will have to rely on the established systems; and they will find that the next crisis they face, unlike the randomness of a hurricane, is merely symptomatic of our country's failure to address the long-term needs of low-income citizens. 
 At this point they may stop wondering at the blameless tragedy of the storm and start wondering why, for example, Congress has still failed to renew a widely praised, proven tool like the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. The tax credit is the catalyst of over 95 percent of the nation's affordable housing production, yet Congress recessed without renewing it for next year. 
 It's time to start thinking in the long term -- to recognize the necessity of programs like the tax credit and make them permanent. Let's respond to emergencies quickly and well, but be certain that we also have long-term systems in place that will prevent, not solidify, the disaster of a permanent underclass in our society.

"145","Hard Times for Women in Construction",559712,"|new york|region",29,9,1992,"19920929T000000",NA," 
 Lisa Narducci gets up at 5 every morning to commute to the Coney Island Water Pollution Control Project. With the acrid stench of sewage rising around her, she drills and saws through plywood, crawls over hot concrete and lifts wooden planks -- all part of her day's work as a carpenter. 
 There are no separate changing rooms for her or the other five women on the job. There are no separate bathrooms. The trailers have pin-ups of naked women on the wall. Sometimes, a co-worker or supervisor says he doubts she can do her job. 
 Still, she is glad to be there. 
 Ms. Narducci and other women in the building trades find themselves fighting battles they thought they won years ago. They fight for the few jobs left in the depressed construction market. They face competitive fears and pejorative comments from their male co-workers. And they are reluctant to complain about working conditions or harassment, believing that troublemakers get dismissed quickly when there are plenty of unemployed replacements. An Uneasy Peace 
 After winning a foothold in the late 1970's and achieving an uneasy peace with male co-workers and bosses in the 1980's, women in the construction industry are seeing their numbers dwindle and their gains disappear. Some quit because the early hours, heavy lifting and danger of the work were not to their liking. But others left because they tired of what the felt was a hostile environment. 
 There are no definite figures about the number of women in the construction trades in New York City, in large part because union officials say they do not track their membership by sex. In 1990, the NOW Legal Defense Fund estimated that women made up about 4 percent of the almost 100,000 workers in the skilled trades, a number with which most industry experts agree. But they say the number has dropped since then. 
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which only keeps nationwide figures on the women in the construction trades, says women have dropped back from the minuscule advances they had made in the 1980's. The most recent figures show that women held 81,000 jobs in the building trades in 1991, or 1.9 percent of the total, down from 2 percent the year before. 
 In New York City, women may be having a particularly hard time because of the hard times hurting all construction workers: union officials estimate that between 50 and 60 percent of the work force is currently unemployed. 
 ""Women who would have entered the industry are not entering because of the job situation,"" said Raymond O'Kane, assistant to the president of the District Council of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters. ""And women who are part of the union but have a family to feed or themselves to feed are dropping out because they can't find work."" 
 But Peggy Crull, the director of research for the city's Human Rights Commission, said the recession was not totally to blame. 'Women Are Discouraged 
 ""It's not that the numbers are dropping because of the recession,"" said Ms. Crull, who is compiling a report from hearings the commission held in 1990 on minorities in the construction trades. ""The numbers are dropping because women are discouraged. My sense is that women are being discouraged."" 
 The women who do remain readily admit such discouragement. Ms. Narducci, who began training as a carpenter 11 years ago, said she was less willing than she used to be to ask for such things as separate bathrooms. 
 ""I am sticking my neck out,"" she said. ""Here I am waltzing onto the job, telling them to hire more women, and now I want a bathroom."" 
 And the stereotypes women encounter on the job have not changed very much, despite years of women getting the work done. 
 Paul McEnery, project manager for the Perini Corporation, the contractor on the Coney Island sewage plant site, which is actually in Sheepshead Bay, said women cannot be expected to lift 200-pound slabs of concrete, for instance. But Ms. Narducci and another carpenter, Dolores Laureano, built a small upper floor of the plant out of those very concrete slabs. 
 Ms. Narducci said one of her foremen had questioned whether she could carry the wooden poles used to make scaffolding. 
 ""That really upset me, because once they think you can't handle something, then you're expendable,"" she said. ""Even if the doubts are only in their imagination."" 
 One of the general foremen on the site, Gene Kelly, said he could trust Ms. Narducci and Ms. Laureano to do any work he gave them. ""The only problem,"" he joked, ""is I can't yell at them the same way I do my other workers."" Why? ""I'm afraid they would cry."" 
 In the face of such enduring stereotypes and of continued harassment, women are leaving or not entering the trades, and those that remain are trying to maintain the few concessions they have won over the years. Many of them regret that they did not do more to recruit other women in the 1980's, when openings were plentiful during the city's building boom. 
 ""We all think that the heyday was in the 80's, but it wasn't much of a heyday,"" said Barbara Trees, a carpenter. ""We were all learning our trades, trying to survive on our job sites, trying to get used to it all. I don't think we had a chance to build a movement."" 
 That is why she and Ms. Narducci began a women's committee of carpenters this summer. They want to push to maintain the number of women in the trade and to look for ways to recruit more. 
 Both women were surprised when the District Council of the union responded favorably to their idea for a committee. In many ways, the women and their union leaders acknowledge they are working toward more common goals than ever before. 
 The women want job security and better working conditions, and they know the union must be part of providing those. The union leaders need more strong pro-union employees and enough women to fill hiring goals on government jobs, and they realize that their female members can help them with both. 
 At the Coney Island water pollution plant, as on most federally financed projects, the declining number of women vying for jobs means it is more difficult to meet the 6.9 percent hiring goal fixed by the Department of Labor. There are more than 90 workers on the site, 6 of whom are women. 
 That may sound like it is easier for women to get hired these days but that is not always the case. For instance, the contractor was only able to meet the goal when Ms. Narducci, who was not sent by her union, asked for a job and then recommended another female carpenter. 
 Most contractors do not have to meet hiring goals, because they only exist on Federal jobs. And they say they are glad to avoid the problem. 
 ""It's difficult to set a number or a percentage and say there have to be that many women on the site,"" said K. Robert Najarian, a vice president of A-J Contracting Company Inc. ""There may not be enough women in certain trades. That may create some false economics."" 
 Frank McArdle, managing director of the General Contractors Association, said the contractors his trade group represents -- more than 700 heavy and highway construction companies -- must comply with Federal hiring numbers on Government jobs. He said the only trade that has caused a consistent problem has been the iron workers, who have had difficulty finding women who can pass the agility and confidence tests. The union and the State Department of Transportation have had meetings to discuss recruiting more qualified women for the trade. 
 Some women resent the pressure to put them on Government-financed jobs. But private jobs have all but ceased in New York, as have those financed by the city. And with them have gone most chances for younger women who want to break into the building trades. The electricians' union, for example, stopped its apprenticeship program this year. 
 Many contractors are also hiring nonunion employees, which means there is even less pressure to hire women. 
 Nontraditional Employment for Women, a local organization that provides training for women, has cut back its programs for would-be construction workers. In July the group began a new program to train women for maintenance and repair jobs, which pay less than construction jobs but have more openings at this time. 
 Even more experienced women are becoming fed up with continuing battles on the work site and in the union hall. 
 ""There is a high dropout rate among women in general,"" said Laura Kelber, who has worked as an electrician for 11 years, ""especially when they become journeywomen and realize that they're not going to be treated any better."" 
 Mr. McArdle of the contractors' association said he did not see the high dropout rate in the construction trades as a gender issue. ""A lot of people decide this is not what they want to be doing for the rest of their lives,"" he said. 
 But the women who remain in the construction trades say the benefits are worth fighting for, and many remain optimistic. ""Think about those women 90 years ago, who died in jail on hunger strikes for their rights,"" Ms. Narducci said. ""It could be worse."" 
 The women point to the high pay they receive for the work they love and say that is all they've ever wanted -- to be able to do their work and earn wages equal to men's. 
 ""Women working in the construction trades was not a romantic idea,"" Ms. Trees said. ""We were saying, 'If you won't pay us equally for so-called women's work, we will go where you are and you will have to pay us the same.' """
"146","Walcott, Poet of Caribbean, Is Awarded the Nobel Prize",561689,"|front page|books",9,10,1992,"19921009T000000",NA," 
 Derek Walcott, the West Indian poet whose luminous writings evoke the cultural diversity and richness of the Caribbean, won the Nobel Prize in Literature yesterday. 
 The Swedish Academy of Letters said in its formal announcement in Stockholm that Mr. Walcott, who is 62 years old, was being honored for his ""melodious and sensitive"" style. 
 The academy's citation noted Mr. Walcott's ""historical vision, the outcome of a multi-cultural commitment."" Spokesman for a Culture 
 ""In his literary works Walcott has laid a course for his own cultural environment, but through them he speaks to each and every one of us,"" the academy's citation reads. ""In him, West Indian culture has found its great poet."" 
 This year's Nobel Prize carries a cash award of $1.2 million. The formal presentation for Nobel laureates from all fields will be on Dec. 10 in Stockholm. 
 Mr. Walcott teaches literature and creative writing at Boston University and lives in Brookline, Mass., but he was born on St. Lucia. He said yesterday that ""all the races of the world"" are represented in the Caribbean, giving a ""tremendous possibility of an example of unity."" 
 ""That sounds pompous, but I mean it,"" he told The Associated Press, saying he was ""still a little stunned"" about winning the award. 
 Although acclaimed as a poet, Mr. Walcott is also a playwright, journalist and painter. He divides his time between the United States and Trinidad, and it is the Caribbean that serves as the source of his poetry's cadences and idioms. He has often been praised for his ability to fuse the classics, folklore and history and to combine the vernacular and the grand manner. 
 Mr. Walcott's latest poetic work, ""Omeros"" (1990), which runs 325 pages, ""weaves his many strands into a whole,"" the academy said. Mr. Walcott has said that ""Omeros,"" whose principal characters have names taken from the ""Iliad"" and ""Odyssey"" of Homer, was meant to capture ""the whole experience of the people of the Caribbean."" 
 The academy, an 18-member assembly of Swedish authors and academics, selects Nobel winners by consensus. The selection of Mr. Walcott fits the academy's pattern of trying to encompass varying styles, languages and cultures with the award. Last year, the winner was Nadine Gordimer, the South African writer. The most recent poet to win was Octavio Paz, a Mexican, in 1990. 
 Although the academy refuses to give the names of other contenders, Swedish publishers and cultural editors said heavy favorites in speculation preceding the prize announcement included the Trinidad-born novelist V. S. Naipaul, the Irish poet Seamus Heaney and Hugo Claus, a Belgian poet, playwright and novelist who writes in Flemish. 
 Mr. Walcott has long been mentioned by Swedish publishers and cultural editors as a front-runner for the award, and the academy's decision was greeted with enthusiasm yesterday throughout the literary community. 
 Harold Bloom, the author and literary critic who teaches at Yale University, said Mr. Walcott ""certainly merits the prize on the basis of his poetic accomplishment and as a representative figure in terms of the English-language poetry that has come out of the West Indies."" 
 The novelist Jamaica Kincaid, who was born in Antigua, said of Mr. Walcott's writing, ""It says to me that I'm very alive."" 
 ""Our historical experience becomes this important thing that I never knew before,"" she said in a telephone interview from her home in Vermont. ""I thought we were just part of the riffraff of the British Empire until I read this man and thought: 'Oh, yes, that is me. That is us.' It is a great day to be a British West Indian."" Work Growing Out of Life 
 Mr. Walcott was born in 1930 in the town of Castries in St. Lucia, a former British colony in the Lesser Antilles.  The Swedish Academy noted that his experience growing up on an isolated volcanic island had apparently greatly influenced his life and work. His poetry includes ""In a Green Night,"" the 1962 collection that is viewed as his breakthrough, and ""Another Life,"" his autobiographical poem of 1973. Among his more significant plays -- which tend to be more loosely structured than his carefully honed poetry -- are several bittersweet tales of life in the Caribbean, including ""Dream on Monkey Mountain,"" ""The Joker of Seville"" and ""O Babylon!"" 
 Mr. Walcott's work also reflects a struggle to confront the colonial past of his native Caribbean and his mixed-race background, which combines an African, Dutch and English ancestry. His grandmothers were said to have been descendants of slaves and he has white grandfathers on both sides of the family. In ""Another Life,"" he speaks of himself as ""the divided child of the wrong color."" 
 ""Three loyalties are central for him,"" the academy said, ""the Caribbean where he lives, the English language and his African origin."" 
 In the poem ""A Far Cry From Africa,"" he wrote, ""How choose/Between this Africa and the English tongue I love?"" His poetry also addresses the bitter legacy of slavery.  In his 1979 work about Jamaica, ""The Star-Apple Kingdom,"" he wrote of the ""groom, the cattleboy, the housemaid"" and ""the good Negroes down in the village, their mouths in the locked jaw of a silent scream."" 
 In interviews, Mr. Walcott has recalled his island childhood and its influence on his work. He told The New Yorker in 1971 that islands ""are a great place to live because the sea is close and there is the elemental feeling of things that are bigger than you are."" The son of two schoolteachers, he also told the magazine that he, his twin brother and elder sister ""grew up with a terrific mother in a house full of books."" Mr. Walcott's father, who was also a painter, died when Mr. Walcott was 1 year old. His brother, Roderick, is a poet. 
 Mr. Walcott has said that he came early to an appreciation of poetry. In an interview with The New York Times in 1982, he said that he became infatuated with the style of great English poetry as a schoolboy, which ""cultivated colonials"" presented to him as ""living speech."" His first collection of poetry was privately printed, under the name D. A. Walcott, when he was still a teen-ager. He designed the book to resemble the distinctive Faber collections of Eliot, Auden and other major contemporary poets published in England. 
 Having failed to win a scholarship to England because of his poor math scores, Mr. Walcott won a scholarship to the University of the West Indies in Jamaica, where he majored in French, Latin and Spanish. On a Rockefeller Foundation grant in New York in 1957 and 1958, he attended Jose Quintero's directing classes and the rehearsals of th Phoenix Theater's repertory company. By the time he was 30, he had published two volumes of poetry, established the Trinidad Theater Workshop and had his plays being performed throughout the Caribbean and in London. 
 In 1981, Mr. Walcott received a $250,000 award from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in Chicago, one of the series of awards intended to support ""exceptionally talented individuals."" 
 That same year a student at Harvard, where Mr. Walcott was teaching a poetry workshop, accused him of sexually harassing her. He denied the charge, but after an investigation the university concluded that it had merit and wrote a letter of reproach to Boston University. 
 Mr. Walcott has spoken of the immense respect that West Indians have for the Caribbean Sea and how his own vision of the world is shaped by waves. In an interview in The New York Times in 1990, he said that that summer was the first time ""I had been around mountains."" 
 ""I was in Colorado,"" he said. ""At first I didn't know what bothered me about them. But then I noticed it: whole ranges of mountains, stacks of them, and they never move."" Mixing the Classical and Folkways 
 Derek Walcott has expressed his love for the classics, folklore and history in his poetry (published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux) and in numerous works for the stage. Here is a list of his published works.  Poetry

"147","THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The South; Loss of Democratic Vote Imperils Bush in South",563723,"|u.s.",18,10,1992,"19921018T000000","|SOUTHERN STATES (US)"," 
 Here in the rolling hills just outside the Talladega National Forest, the leaves are beginning to turn, and so, it seems, are many of the Reagan Democrats. 
 If enough of them vote Democratic in what was supposed to be the rock-solid Republican base, President Bush's re-election hopes could be doomed. ""Clinton's for the common man; Bush is for the rich,"" said Roger Dunaway, a 43-year-old crane operator from nearby Coldwater who voted for Mr. Bush and Ronald Reagan in the past but seems to have nothing but disdain for Mr. Bush now. ""It's time to get the Republicans out of there."" 
 For all but one of the past five Presidential elections, voters like Mr. Dunaway have been responsible for the surest thing in Presidential politics: the Republican stranglehold on the South that has seen the Democrats win only of the 11 old Confederacy states in one of the last three elections. 
 This year enough voters have come back to the Democrats that virtually every Southern state is up for grabs for the first time since the last Democrat, Jimmy Carter, won the White House in 1976. Bush Needs All of the South 
 President Bush is in enough trouble nationally that winning almost all the South this year would not guarantee his re-election. But failing to do it would almost certainly guarantee his defeat. 
 That explains why Gov. Bill Clinton was campaigning today in Louisiana, which has gone Democratic once -- for Mr. Carter in 1976 -- since the election of John F. Kennedy in 1960. Now polls show the candidates to be evenly matched there. 
 ""The No. 1 strategic objective for the Republicans has to be a re-creation of an almost solid South,"" said Earl Black, a University of South Carolina political scientist. ""If they can't do it, I don't see how they can find enough states to win."" 
 From 1880 to 1944 the South regularly voted as a solid Democratic bloc. But by the early 70's the South was becoming a Republican Presidential stronghold, and by the 1980's the Democrats could carry just one Southern state: Jimmy Carter's Georgia in 1980. 
 This year, however, the South is the nation's most competitive region, including Texas with 32 electoral votes, Florida with 25, North Carolina with 14 and Georgia with 13. For the last eight years, all 11 states, with 27 percent of the nation's electoral votes, went Republican. 
 ""I keep pinching myself,"" said Al LaPierre, executive director of the Alabama Democratic Party, where Mr. Bush won 61 percent of the vote in 1988 and polls now show the race even. ""It's been 16 years since we've come to the middle of October neck and neck. Usually, we're 17 points down."" Economy Is No. 1 Issue 
 Mr. Bush clearly stands a chance to win all the region, with the exception of Arkansas and perhaps Tennessee; that could salvage his campaign. But there is a fear among some Republicans that his lagging prospects nationally could compound his problems in the South, where the economy remains the dominant issue and the old value-laden issues that once dominated elections seem to have lost their punch. 
 Not that it is hard to find Bush supporters in the South. Interviews with two dozen white voters at shopping malls Mississippi turned up only one solidly for Mr. Clinton. 
 And in Alabama, many of those who have voted Republican in the past plan to do so again. 
 ""No way I'd vote for Clinton,"" said Bobby Miller, poking his head up from under the hood of a car he was working on at his service station here. ""Some of his issues, abortion, defending homosexuals, may be O.K. for some people, but not for me."" 
 But here and across the South it is clear that the sour economy, Mr. Bush's political weaknesses, the all-Southern Democratic ticket and the ways in which the political arithmetic of the South can work against the Republicans are imperiling the Republican base. 'No Way I'd Vote for Bush' 
 All seven of the people congregating near a string of antique and curio shops next to Cotton's produce stand here voted for Mr. Bush in 1988. They were in a majority of 72 percent of the white Alabama voters that year. Now one is firmly for Mr. Bush, one firmly for Mr. Clinton and another leaning that way, one for Ross Perot, one planning to vote for the Libertarian Party, one too disgusted to vote and one too confused to say what she will do. 
 It is anything but the solid Republican South. 
 ""No way I'd vote for Bush,"" said Elizabeth Horn, who says she will not vote this year. ""We've seen what Reagan and Bush have done. The butter's fallen off the biscuits."" 
 Interviews across the region indicate the problems may be particularly severe with women voters. Lisa Kety, a 31-year-old lawyer from Folsom, La., who voted for Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush in 1988, said she supported Mr. Clinton largely because of the Republican opposition to abortion rights. 
 Like the rest of the nation, Mr. Bush is hurt most by the economy. But in the South there is an added kicker. The Republican dominance of the last 12 years has come in states where the Democrats generally dominate at the state level and where Republicans still have to fight the image of being the party of the wealthy. 'Hurting Economically' 
 Natalie Davis, a political science professor at Birmingham Southern College, said 45 percent of the Reagan Democrats polled in Alabama said they were worse off today than four years ago, as against 31 percent of all voters. 
 That poses a tough hurdle for any President. But some analysts say Mr. Bush, unlike Mr. Reagan, may not be the kind of Republican who can sell in the South during hard times. 
 ""The rural and small-town South is hurting economically, and who do they see in there?"" said Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst. ""Do they see a middle-class Nixon or Reagan? No, they see Mr. Pinstripes from Kennebunkport and Skull and Bones, who's the old Republican bogeyman."" 
 Also hurting the Republicans is the degree to which economic issues are trumping social ones in this election. In the past, value-laden issues played strongest in the South. This year, even though issues like Mr. Clinton's draft history probably do more for the Republicans in the South than elsewhere, few voters seem to mention the draft as a defining issue. 
 Even race, the issue that in overt and subtle ways helped transform the South from solidly Democratic to solidly Republican, seems to be off the table. 
 ""I think the Rodney King thing probably blew any chance that they would try to make that an issue, because sometimes issues, even in a subliminal and subtle way, are too hot to handle,"" said Matt Towery, a Republican who is running unopposed for state representative in Cobb County outside Atlanta.  Factoring the Black Vote 
 In fact, if race has helped create the new Republican South, this year may show that it can work for the Democrats as well. 
 Despite the well-publicized squabbles between Mr. Clinton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, blacks seem solidly and often enthusiastically behind Mr. Clinton and and his running mate, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, who are both typical of the Democratic moderates who run well in the South. 
 In states like Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina and Louisiana, where blacks can make up more than 30 percent of the electorate, a solid black vote for Mr. Clinton means Mr. Bush needs more than 60 percent of the white vote to win. To the extent Mr. Perot is a factor, he tends to help Mr. Clinton in the South by drawing white voters from Mr. Bush. 
 ""If Clinton and Bush more or less divide the white vote, the Republicans have no hope,"" Professor Black said. 
 Compounding the Republican weaknesses, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore have run close to a perfect race for the South, blunting social issues like the death penalty and welfare and hitting hard on economic ones. 
 ""The key was nominating two moderate Southerners and distancing themselves a bit from Jesse Jackson and appealing to Reagan Democrats to come home,"" said William Barnard, a history professor at the University of Alabama. ""It's worked."" 
 Still, the strength of the Democrats this year is really just enough to keep them in the game, not insured victories. Some supporters of Mr. Bush think the South is too conservative not to finally drift back to the Republicans. 
 ""I know what the polls say, but I think this will be like the Atlanta Braves game the other night,"" said Mr. Miller, the car mechanic. ""It was hard to see how they were going to win, but they did."" 
 For now, in addition to Arkansas and Tennessee, the Clinton campaign is given its best chances in North Carolina, Georgia and perhaps Louisiana. The Republicans seem strongest in Mississippi and South Carolina, and are certain to throw everything they can at must-win states like Florida and Texas. The difference is the Democrats would be thrilled with a split of the South. The Republicans need to come close to wining it all. 
 ""I think this is like 1980, where, with the exception of Texas and Florida, where the Republicans won big, most of these states were very tight races,"" Professor Black said. ""I could easily see all of these states going either way. I could see a sweep for Clinton or a sweep for Bush. But I think it's more likely at this point to be a sweep for Clinton."" 
 Correction:  October 25, 1992, Sunday

 Bill Keller has written a remarkable account of the violence surrounding the hostels in South Africa (""Island of Fear: Inside a Soweto Hostel,"" Sept. 20). But I was sorry to see him describe the violence as ""black on black,"" which, as he says in the article, is something the South African Government likes to do. 
 I have never seen the conflict between the Croats and Serbs characterized as ""white on white"" violence. Why must racial terms be used here?

 ALLEN SINAI Chief economist, the Boston Company in Boston 
 There are several important statistics to watch, according to Mr. Sinai, and none of them give much comfort. Though the employment rolls are growing, they are increasing at only 30 percent to 40 percent of the average rate after a recession, with temporary workers accounting for most of the gains. ""The economy is still underperforming,"" Mr. Sinai said. ""Payrolls in particular are growing at an unsatisfactory rate."" Though new business incorporations have increased since the depths of the recession, they are also doing so at about half the rate normal after a recession, Mr. Sinai said. As a precaution, the new administration should be ready to put off balancing the budget to concentrate on growth. To do that, first-year spending on the infrastructure should be increased to $50 billion ""if the economy flattens out."" 
 LAWRENCE CHIMERINE Senior economic adviser, DRI/McGraw Hill in Philadelphia 
 President-elect Bill Clinton has a tough road ahead, said Lawrence Chimerine. To get the economy moving, Mr. Clinton's proposed $20 billion investment in the nation's infrastructure next year should be increased to about $50 billion. But Mr. Clinton is not the only one with a difficult future. Workers have been losing ground and will continue to do so. Real wages did not grow in the last two years and will fall further. That has hurt consumers, who, rather than spending, have been sitting tight.Without spending, the economy will remain sluggish. Though hiring is expected to creep up, layoffs haven't hit bottom yet. And there is likely to be further downward pressure on wages as military suppliers cut back. ""Clinton's plan has to be a massive defense conversion plan."" MICKEY D. LEVY  Chief economist, CRT Government Securities in New York 
 For Mr. Levy, even without any new proposals from Washington, the trend is up on the job front, albeit modestly. The ""numbers are clearly pointing to a turnaround, with most of the losses in employment behind us,"" he said. The wrenching restructuring undergone by corporate America since the recession began has resulted in big increases in productivity. That has boosted bottom lines with five quarters in a row of steadily increasing profits. Mr. Levy forecasts profits will continue to increase through the end of 1993. But while cost cutting has made businesses leaner and more competitive, painful memories of layoffs will serve to keep companies' optimism in check. ""Companies will continue to keep a lid on expenses. I don't expect any hiring sprees."""
"150","Architecture Award to Kevin Roche",576576,"|arts",14,12,1992,"19921214T000000",NA," 
 Kevin Roche, an architect noted for corporate headquarters and skyscrapers that epitomize the evolution of modern architecture in the postwar decades, has been named the recipient of the 1993 Gold Medal from the American Institute of Architects. His best-known buildings include the Ford Foundation Building in New York, the Oakland Museum and the General Foods Corporation headquarters in Rye Brook, N.Y. 
 Mr. Roche, who is 70 years old and was born in Ireland, first came to prominence as a partner of Eero Saarinen, whose firm he joined in 1950. After Saarinen's death in 1961, Mr. Roche took over the design of several major Saarinen projects, including the CBS Building in New York and the TWA Terminal at Kennedy International Airport. In 1966 Saarinen's firm was renamed Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo & Associates. That same year saw the completion of the Ford Foundation headquarters, a building that secured Mr. Roche's reputation as a leading American modernist. A Change in Approach 
 Since then, Mr. Roche's Connecticut-based firm has designed a number of major projects in New York, including the United Nations Plaza Hotel, the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum, for which he also devised the master plan, the Central Park Zoo, the Morgan Stanley Building and a new addition to the Jewish Museum. In his more recent projects Mr. Roche has departed from an early adherence to modernism's crisp geometric lines, and the exteriors of his buildings reflected a richer, more eclectic approach. 
 First awarded in 1907, the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal is one of the architectural profession's highest honors. Its past recipients include Frank Lloyd Wright, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier, Eero Saarinen and Louis I. Kahn. The award is to be presented to Mr. Roche in January at a ceremony at the National Building Museum in Washington."

 To the Editor: 
 Struck by the contradiction between the need for humanitarian aid to Somalia and the lack of it for Bosnia and Herzegovina, I read with horror ""Rape After Rape After Rape"" (Op-Ed, Dec. 13), about the brutal rape of Muslim and Croatian women, estimated at 50,000, by Serbian militia soldiers. 
 Let us examine the differences. We (Western European-Americans) have a history of helping blacks (colonization, slavery and institutional discrimination). The news media have assisted this issue with publication of endless pictures of pathetic, dying children. We have huge stockpiles of desert gear for our military. 
 But in Bosnia, the Bush Administration and Western leaders argue it is too hard to stop the genocide. We have refused to arm the Muslims, but have done nothing to defend them; we have banned Serbian flights over Bosnia, but there has been no enforcement. Moreover, I suspect Western distrust and unfamiliarity with Muslims also make them an unsympathetic group. Yet stories of atrocities persist, causing more than one analyst to draw parallels with Hitler's policies of genocide against Jews. 
 This genocide is being perpetrated against Muslim and Croatian women through these brutal rapes and impregnating them, sentencing them and the subsequent children to be outcasts from whatever is left of their society. But it's only rape; they'll get over it. It's only women. It's only women. ALICE ABEL KEMP  New Orleans, Dec. 14, 1992"

 To the Editor: 
 We shouldn't be surprised at Milan Panic's defeat in the Yugoslav elections, as you seem to be in ""No Easy Out for Bosnia"" (editorial, Dec. 23). Nor should we blame the voters for it. In a way, despite Washington's alleged support of his candidacy, we have helped his defeat. 
 To start with, we approved Mr. Panic's travel to Belgrade to assume the position of Prime Minister in a country with which we maintain a questionable diplomatic relationship and where we have no ambassador in place. What kind of support were we giving him? 
 We strengthened the economic sanctions during the electoral campaign without making it clear that they would be abolished should Mr. Panic win. 
 We implicitly contemplated the possibility of bombing the Serbs if they did not change their stand. 
 Last and psychologically most important, on the eve of the elections we published the list of Mr. Panic's opponents (Slobodan Milosevic's supporters), branding them criminals. It is we who hold that a person is innocent until proved guilty. 
 News reports from Belgrade said Mr. Panic's supporters were aghast when they heard Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger's announcement, while President Milosevic's forces claimed a touchdown. To anyone familiar with the Serbian mentality, call it even stubbornness -- odd as it may sound -- we goofed. Our tactic was wrong and ended by antagonizing the voters rather than attracting them to Mr. Panic. 
 It is unfortunate that we did not use a more knowledgeable, diplomatic approach in this important and delicate matter. MILLORAD DEVIAK Chevy Chase, Md., Dec. 26, 1992"

 Two people were shot to death and three others were wounded early yesterday after a dispute erupted at a warehouse party in Brooklyn and spilled out onto the street, the police said. 
 The shooting occurred about 4:30 A.M. in front of S & S Corrugated Paper Machinery Inc., at 160 North Fourth Street in Williamsburg, where the party was held, said a police spokesman, Sgt. John McCluskey. 
 Residents in the neighborhood said about 70 people attended the party, which started about 11 P.M. Many young people loitered outside the building, listening to loud music from car stereos, they said. Shortly after midnight, the police told them to be quiet and ordered them inside the building. But many went back out moments after the police left, neighbors said. 'I Saw 10 Kids' 
 ""Sometime around 4:30 A.M. I was awakened by what sounded like firecrackers and ran to the window,"" said one neighbor, who would not let his name be used out of fear of retribution. The police recovered a submachinegun from the scene and about 20 spent shell casings. 
 Late yesterday, investigators were still trying to determine what the dispute was about and who fired the shots, Sergeant McCluskey said. 
 Francisco Espina Maldanado, 24, of 801 Driggs Avenue, and Eric Rivera of 417 Lorimer Street, both in Williamburg, died of gunshot wounds to the chest at Woodhull Hospital, said Sergeant McCluskey. 
 Timothy Aguila, 16, who was shot in the left foot, and John Leggio, 22, who was shot in the abdomen, were listed in serious but stable condition at Woodhull Hospital. Richard Rodriguez, 20, who was shot in the back, was listed in serious but stable condition at Beth Israel Hospital, the police said."

"155","In '92, Largest Nassau Deficit",592190,"|new york|region",23,2,1993,"19930223T000000","|NASSAU COUNTY (NY)"," 
 The Nassau County Comptroller's office closed the books today on the 1992 budget, revealing what everyone had expected: a $119.9 million deficit in the county's general fund. 
 Alan Gurien, the acting comptroller, said the deficit -- about $1 million less than earlier projections -- was the largest in county history. The 1992 general fund budget was about $1.1 billion. 
 There are already some problems in this year's budget, involving an unknown number of county positions that lack financing, Mr. Gurien said. 
 While this year's budget comes with claims that it will eliminate the deficit, the figures released today suggest that some items that contributed to last year's deficit remain -- though in a more manageable form. 
 The 1993 budget proposes largely to eliminate the county's deficit through $65 million in long-term borrowing, about $31 million in a transfer from the police fund and by keeping the county's payroll down from what it was two years ago. 
 Mr. Gurien, echoing the views of many county officials, said today that the problems of 1993 should be minimal compared with those of 1992, which he likened to a ""forest fire that burns down everything so that we can start growing again."" Last year, the county laid off thousands of workers. 
 According to figures released by Mr. Gurien today, the 1992 deficit was largely a result of, among other things, $38.3 million in lost revenue from failing to sell a parcel of county land; $33.5 million in unanticipated payroll expenditures; $15.5 million in sales tax shortfalls; $14.9 million in state aid shortfalls, and $27.7 million in unexpected subsidies to the Nassau County Medical Center, the A. Holly Patterson Geriatric Center and the county road fund. This was partly offset by unexpected savings of $14.2 million in the Department of Social Services, Mr. Gurien said. 
 Some of these variances are unlikely to arise again in this year's budget. For instance, county officials have lowered their projections for sales tax revenues and state aid in 1993."

"157","Choice and Journey's End In Canadian Hotel Venture",604005,"|business",22,4,1993,"19930422T000000","|CANADA"," 
 Choice Hotels International, the franchise hotel giant, said yesterday that it had formed a joint venture in Canada with the Journey's End Corporation, Canada's biggest hotel management company. The venture, to be called Choice Hotels Canada Inc., will initially have 174 inns, 120 of them currently owned by Journey's End. 
 ""Together we expect to have over 500 hotels in the Canadian market in the next four or five years,"" said Gerald Petitt, president and chief operating officer of Choice, who described the joint venture as ""a truly equal partnership."" The board of directors will be ""50-50,"" he said, ""and we'll split the profits right down the middle."" 
 With headquarters in Silver Spring, Md., Choice, a subsidiary of Manor Care Inc., had franchise revenues last year of just over $100 million. Its seven chains operate under the banners Clarion, Comfort, Econo Lodge, Friendship, Quality, Rodeway and Sleep Inns. Because they range from economy to upscale, two or more sometimes operate side by side. Revenues of $116 Million 
 Journey's End, with headquarters in Toronto, had revenues last year of about $116 million. Most of its properties are in Canada, although it also has a hotel in midtown Manhattan. The company's stock lost 50 cents yesterday, closing at $5.50 (Canadian) on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
 Maurice Rollins, its founder and chief executive, will become chairman of Choice Hotels Canada. Its motels will be called Comfort Inns by Journey's End, its hotels Quality Hotels by Journey's End and its suites Quality Suites by Journey's End. 
 The venture will not affect ownership of current Journey's End properties, most of which are owned through limited partnerships. 
 The venture links the management ability of Journey's End with Choice's marketing muscle and sophisticated reservations system. That two-year-old system lets each hotel monitor and change its own room rates and inventory, as well as book guests at other Choice-brand hotels at their prevailing rates. Strategy Accelerated 
 The venture also accelerates the strategy of Choice to seek growth outside the United States through relationships with local franchise operators. 
 Canada is an especially good markeplace for Choice's strategy, Mr. Petitt said, because about two-thirds of its hotels there are independent operations, compared with only one-third in the United States. 
 James Carper, editor in chief of Hotels, the magazine of the international hotel industry, said the venture appeared to be a good one. 
 ""One reason the franchise operations have to grow outside the United States,"" he said, ""is that there isn't much more opportunity in this country. That's why they're grabbing each others' hotels and going abroad."" 
 While only about 310 of Choice's 2,900 hotels are outside the United States, in 29 countries, many more are under construction or in development abroad. 
 For example, Choice signed a franchise agreement last year with CDL Hotels International of Singapore, to develop more than 30 hotels in Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, Hong Kong, the Philippines and mainland China. Choice's partner in Mexico, Hoteles Calinda, has 16 Choice-brand hotels there. Other franchise agreements call for 20 new Choice-brand hotels in Venezuela and 10 in Costa Rica.

"160","Hotel Profits for 1992 Show A Slow but Steady Recovery",609946,"|business",19,5,1993,"19930519T000000","|UNITED STATES"," 
 In a sharp, unexpected turnabout, more than half the nation's hotels turned a profit last year -- the first time since 1989 that more than 50 percent were profitable. 
 A study released yesterday by the accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand, a leading consultant to the United States hospitality industry, showed that 51.5 percent of hotels were profitable last year, up from 39.9 percent in 1991. 
 In another indication that a slow, steady recovery is under way in the industry, room occupancy in the first quarter rose to 58.5 percent -- the highest rate of any first quarter since 1990. The two percentage point increase in occupancy over the 1992's first quarter was the biggest of any comparable period since 1989. The occupancy statistics were compiled by Smith Travel Research of Gallatin, Tenn., for the American Hotel and Motel Association. Rate Increases Expected 
 ""What this means,"" said Bjorn Hanson, chairman of hospitality industry consulting at Coopers & Lybrand, ""is that the hotel recovery is under way and there's a good chance that in 1995 room rates will increase greater than the rate of inflation."" 
 Hotel rate increases have trailed the rate of inflation since 1987, Mr. Hanson said, and next year, they are likely to lag behind slightly. ""But rates should be slightly higher than inflation in 1995,"" he added, ""and occupancy should be close to 68 percent, compared with 62.2 percent last year."" 
 The Smith Travel Research data show that room rates in the first quarter, historically the slowest in the lodging industry, averaged $61.35, or 2 percent more than the $60.07 average for the similar 1991 quarter. Smith also noted that while the Consumer Price Index rose more than 13 percent from the first quarter of 1989 through the first quarter of 1993, room rates increased only 5.5 percent. 
 Recovery appears to have been in the wings for at least several months. December's 48.1 percent occupancy rate was the highest for that month -- the industry's slowest -- since Smith Travel began compiling such figures in 1986. And in February, a report by the real estate services group of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen & Company said the industry might be heading for recovery. 
 Still, Mr. Hanson said, ""I think the industry didn't expect there would be such an improvement in one year."" 
 He attributed the increase in hotel profitability to the higher occupancy rates, the decline in interest rate burdens, because many hotels had restructured delinquent loans, and cost-containment measures, including lower taxes resulting from property tax appeals. 
 The Coopers & Lybrand report noted that the American Council of Life Insurance had said that the percentage of delinquent principal on hotel loans fell to 14.29 percent at the end of 1992 from a peak of 15.89 percent in the second quarter of 1992. 
 Limited-service hotels continue to do better than full-service hotels, the report said. Last year, 28.5 percent of limited-service hotels lost money, an improvement from 40.3 percent the year before. In 1992, 57.1 percent of full-service hotels recorded losses, an improvement from 68.4 percent in 1991. 
 Lenders will still be wary about investing in hotels until at least 1997, Mr. Hanson said, and not all hotels will benefit equally from the recovery. ""There are still many hotels that are the wrong product and built on the wrong site,"" he said, ""and they may never be successful."" 
 Many such hotels were built primarily as tax write-offs, but the Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated most real estate tax shelters of that type.  COMPANY NEWS"
"161","Light Penalty for Speculator In Japan Stock Manipulation",610109,"|business",20,5,1993,"19930520T000000","|JAPAN"," 
 Mitsuhiro Kotani, a corporate raider whose shadowy stock market maneuvers in the 1980's toppled major politicians, bankers and businessmen in a web of illicit activities, was handed a light suspended sentence today after being convicted of a multimillion-dollar stock manipulation scheme. 
 Mr. Kotani has become a symbol of the excesses of what was known here as the bubble era, a period when stock and real estate prices rose to exaggerated levels before collapsing during the 1990's 
 He rose to a dominant position in the market in the late 1980's. He was often pictured in popular publications with business and political leaders, and boasted that he could raise millions of dollars with a few phone calls. 
 He operated through the Koshin group, a loose assemblage of wealthy individuals and companies. It staged Japan's first and last hostile takeover, of an aerial surveying company called Kokusai Kogyo, in 1988. 
 But Mr. Kotani's downfall was swift. After the stock market began to collapse in 1990, his empire unraveled, and with it his links to the financiers and power brokers. Government officials have characterized his activities as an aberration, but his ties to the establishment were deep and broad, as suggested by the list of billionaires, Government ministers and bankers that he brought down. Faced Two Indictments 
 Mr. Kotani has faced two indictments. In one, in which he was found guilty, he was charged with having worked secretly with a group of investors to force up illegally the price of shares in Fujita Tourist Enterprises, a resort group. The manipulation produced millions of dollars in profits for the members of the group. Mr. Kotani was sentenced today to an 18-month suspended sentence, and is unlikely to spend any time in prison. 
 In handing down what was widely regarded as a modest sentence, Shigeru Matsuura, the chief judge, said, ""Please control yourself. You were a spoiled child of the era."" It was the first time the Government had applied a law against stock manipulation. 
 Shuichi Yamamoto, the former head of a construction company, was convicted in the scheme and received a four-month suspended sentence. 
 In the other indictment, Mr. Kotani was charged with extorting 30 billion yen from the Janome Sewing Machine Company, the shares of which he also reportedly manipulated. Mr. Kotani was accused of having acquired a stake in the company, then threatened to sell the shares to gangsters unless the company bought back the shares at above-market prices. 
 The company arranged for payments and loans of several hundred million dollars. Mr. Kotani has denied the charges and the case is pending. Powerful Figures Involved 
 Mr. Kotani is accused of heading the Fujita manipulation scheme and the Janome extortion to pay off debts from the takeover of Kokusai Kogyo. 
 The list of the powerful figures implicated by Mr. Kotani is long. Toshiyuki Inamura, a former minister for environmental protection, was found guilty of having evaded taxes on more than $25 million he earned from trading in shares using insider tips provided by Mr. Kotani. 
 Mr. Kotani's personal physician, Dr. Akiyuki Yamaguchi, pleaded guilty to charges that he failed to pay about 830 million yen in taxes on earnings from stock dealings that relied on information from Mr. Kotani. 
 Hirotomo Takei, one of Japan's wealthiest men, was found guilty of having concealed from the tax authorities 4.3 billion yen in income, most of it earned from trading in shares using inside information provided by Mr. Kotani. 
 Ichiro Isoda was forced to resign as the chairman of the Sumitomo Bank, a huge bank, in part because of disclosures that the bank's executives had arranged $175 million in illegal loans to Mr. Kotani. 
 Takeo Masuno was forced to resign as the president of Kyowa Saitama Bank, one of the largest financial institutions in the world, after it was disclosed that the bank had financed what it knew was an extortion scheme by Mr. Kotani against Janome Sewing Machine."

 SPY TRADER Germany's Devil's Advocate and the Darkest Secrets of the Cold War. By Craig R. Whitney. Illustrated. 375 pp. New York: Times Books/Random House. $25. 
 A FEW hours after dawn on Feb. 10, 1962, a tall, thin Russian wearing dark glasses walked to the center of Berlin's Glienicke Bridge and passed a stocky younger man in a fur cap who was headed in the opposite direction. The Soviet spy Rudolf Ivanovich Abel had been traded for Francis Gary Powers, who had been brought down while flying a U-2 spy plane for the C.I.A. 
 Fifteen miles away at Checkpoint Charlie, far from the cinematic scene on the bridge over the Havel River, an East German lawyer sat quietly in his car awaiting word of the exchange. Wolfgang Vogel's name was unknown at the time, but he had arranged a swap that was a milestone in the history of the cold war. Mr. Vogel had worked out the details with James B. Donovan, the former O.S.S. counsel who had defended Abel at his espionage trial in New York. Ostensibly, Mr. Vogel represented ""Frau Helen Abel,"" Abel's supposed wife. In fact, his clients were the K.G.B. and the Stasi, the East German spy agency. 
 The Powers-Abel trade was the beginning of Mr. Vogel's career as a broker in human lives who earned the respect of officials on both sides of what used to be called the Iron Curtain. Mr. Vogel has opened his files to Craig R. Whitney, the European diplomatic correspondent of The New York Times, and the result is ""Spy Trader: Germany's Devil's Advocate and the Darkest Secrets of the Cold War,"" a carefully documented, absorbing account of the East German lawyer over three decades. Mr. Whitney reports that Mr. Vogel arranged the ransom by West Germany of exactly 33,755 political prisoners held by East Germany and the release of another 215,019 East Germans. They were exchanged for payments by Bonn to the East German Government of nearly 3.5 billion marks. 
 Both sides found Mr. Vogel useful, the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. no less than the K.G.B. Spies get caught, and since Moscow and Washington preferred to pretend their operatives were innocent, the spy trade required a middleman. The larger trade in political prisoners, as Mr. Whitney makes clear, was strictly for cash; East Germany needed hard currency. Mr. Vogel was glad to accommodate everyone. 
 He grew rich in the process -- a gold Mercedes, a country house with the latest Western appliances, a comfortable life. And he believed in what he was doing. His greatest triumph was the trade in 1986 of the Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, who was not a spy, for several prisoners in Western jails who were. 
 Ironically, Mr. Whitney contends, Mr. Vogel helped bring down the German Democratic Republic. The migration westward that he had facilitated became a flood by the fall of 1989. East Germany could no longer control its borders. Erich Honecker, the aging East German leader, did not realize his country was literally walking away from him. 
 In the aftermath of the collapse of Communism, Mr. Whitney says, some of the very people Mr. Vogel had helped turned on him, denouncing him for profiting from their plight. Arrested by German authorities on various criminal charges, then freed, he is still under investigation by prosecutors, his fate uncertain. Mr. Vogel remains what he was, an ambiguous man. He savored his car, his dacha, his sailboat, his collection of Meissen birds -- everything that his Stasi connections and the trade in human beings brought him. In the end, his life was a Faustian bargain. 
 Still, Mr. Vogel earns a measure of cautious sympathy from Mr. Whitney that is not entirely misplaced. Mr. Vogel, after all, was more than a servant of an evil secret police. He gave thousands of people back their freedom -- the most precious gift, as it turned out, that Bonn's marks could buy. 
 David Wise is the author of ""Molehunt,"" a book about the C.I.A.'s search for Soviet spies in its ranks."

 One good place to hide is a municipal bond fund, which invests in the bonds and notes of states and municipalities. The issues, used to finance public projects and services, are backed by the taxing power of issuers or by revenues from toll roads or other projects. 
 The accompanying chart lists the 10 top-performing national muni bond funds ranked by three-year returns, the 9 best muni funds investing in New York and the 10 best for California. The chart excludes funds with annual expenses of more than three-quarters of 1 percent, the average for the group. It also eliminates the most volatile funds and adjusts returns for front-end sales charges. 
 The chief appeal of these funds, of course, is that their income is free from Federal income taxes (although taxes are owed on any capital gains). In the case of the New York and California funds, which invest in debt issued by those states, their municipalities or agencies, income is free from Federal, state and local taxes for state residents. 
 So while munis may yield less than taxable funds, investors keep more after taxes are paid. 
 A fund's ""taxable equivalent yield"" shows how much a taxable investment would have to pay to match the yield of a tax-free fund. To calculate, divide the actual yield by 1 minus your Federal tax rate expressed in decimals. For a taxpayer in the 28 percent bracket, the taxable equivalent yield for a muni bond fund yielding 4.83 percent -- the average for these funds in June -- is 6.71 percent (after subtracting .28 from 1, then dividing 4.83 by .72). 
 Also, interest on issues of specific states is free of state taxes for state residents. Funds note this amount on your end-of-year tax statement. 
 To figure the rough after-tax yield on the single-state funds, divide the fund's yield by one minus your combined Federal and state tax rates, expressed in decimals. 
 Some national and single-state muni funds own ""private purpose"" paper, issued by some municipalities to finance nonessential projects like student loans. Interest on private purpose paper is free from Federal income taxes but subject to the alternative minimum tax. 
 To compensate for the tax liability, private purpose paper normally pays slightly more than regular issues.  People who do not expect to owe the alternative minimum tax, or A.M.T., can increase their yields by owning shares in funds that own more A.M.T. paper. Fund companies can provide this information. 
 While most people view muni funds as solid investments, they carry a serious risk. In general, bond fund prices fall when interest rates rise; the longer the term of the bond, the farther prices fall when rates rise.  Most muni funds carry maturities of more than 20 years. 
 While the top-performing muni funds over time are those with longer maturities, the interim interest-rate risk may be too much for conservative investors. By shortening maturities, investors reduce risk. If interest rates rise 1 percent, an intermediate- term fund's share price should drop only 3 percent, compared with 7 percent for share prices of longer-term funds, said John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds. 
 Of course what is gained in safety is lost in yield. The 59 muni funds sporting short to intermediate maturities yield about three-quarters of a percentage point less than their longer cousins. 
 Because of differences in the quality and maturity of bonds held by the funds, yields vary. So it pays to shop around. The average 12-month yield of the long-term New York funds tracked by Morningstar was 5.49 percent in June. But Putnam New York Tax-Exempt Opportunities yields 6.48 percent, while the laggard, the Warburg Pincus New York Municipal Bond Fund yields only 4.45 percent. The long-term California funds yielded an average of 5.53 percent, but Prudential California Municipal Income A yields 6.51 percent and Muir California Tax-Free Bond Fund yields 4.02 percent. 
 Because of the general erosion in some states' economies, investors in New York and Massachusetts in particular, should keep no more than 40 or 50 percent of their total tax-free portfolio in state bonds, said James F. Lynch, editor of the Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory, a newsletter published in New York. Even in better-managed states, he advised tying up no more than 75 percent of tax-free assets in-state. 
 One way to minimize risk is to buy funds that invest in insured bonds or regular munis that the fund insures itself. The 1983 default by the Washington Public Power Supply System was a harsh reminder that munis are not risk-free. Yet experts say that defaults on individual issues should not pose a problem for investors in funds, because they have diversified portfolios. 
 The price for the added security is negligible because the insurance premium is small. As a group, regular munis returned 10.1 percent for the year ended in June, compared with 10.3 percent for the 76 insured muni funds."

"166","For Homeless, A Last Haven Is Demolished",629575,"|new york|region",18,8,1993,"19930818T000000","|NEW YORK CITY"," 
 Bulldozers yesterday plowed through one of the oldest and last shantytowns in New York City, crushing into bits of plywood and muddy rags one of the most visible symbols of homelessness in Manhattan. 
 Officials said the encampment at the foot of the Manhattan Bridge -- known for an 18-foot teepee that towered over wood and tar paper shacks -- had become a fire hazard and was increasingly plagued with drugs. The site, a knoll called the Hill, was one of many semi-permanent communities created by homeless people in the 1980's in spots from Columbus Circle to Tompkins Square Park to the United Nations. 
 Yesterday morning, it became the latest to be ripped down. Officials said its 50 or so occupants were uprooted for their own safety. But advocates for the homeless saw political purposes in the strike.  'It's Going to Be Rough Now' 
 ""It's been the Dinkins administration policy to get rid of any encampment that appears too visible on the political landscape,"" said Ted Houghton of the Coalition for the Homeless. ""Unfortunately, they have not attacked any of the roots of homelessness. What we've got now is more people on the street than ever, but more spread out than ever before."" 
 City officials and homeless advocates both said the Hill -- known for nearly a decade as an orderly, if rough communal encampment -- appeared to be the largest remaining shantytown in the city. But it was small compared to an earlier settlement at Tompkins Square Park, where as many as 200 people lived. 
 Not long after bulldozer treads bowled over the teepee's bare and charred poles -- its mailbag skin was burned off last year -- one 52-year-old resident said he would miss the Hill. 
 ""It wasn't the best spot in the world, but at least it was something,"" said the man, who calls himself Preacherman, as two machines snorted through the settlement where he lived for three years. ""It's going to be rough now."" 
 In an effort to soften the blow to residents, city workers had visited the encampment daily since Thursday, offering alternate shelter, medical help and admission to programs for drug or alcohol abuse. About 15 residents accepted help, said Howard Salk, the director of outreach for the newly created city Department of Homeless Services. 
 Advocates for the homeless said the city acted too swiftly, and the Coalition for the Homeless, which learned of the decision to raze the Hill only on Monday, tried to block the destruction in court. A judge declined a request for a restraining order, but the city agreed in negotiations to store the property of any resident who asked. 
 Many shantytown residents interviewed yesterday said they wanted no part of the city's system of homeless shelters, but were also not happy about returning to the streets where many had lived before. 
 ""You sleep out on the street and you've got to worry about someone robbing you or setting you on fire,"" said Al Fell, 37, who lived in a small hut at the Hill off and on for five years. ""Here, you don't have to worry about that."" Encampment Had Changed 
 The decision to demolish the Hill, which had slowly spread to cover a 20,000-square-foot lot at Canal and Chrystie Streets in Chinatown, was notable because the settlement had received so much attention in newspaper and magazine articles about homelessness. In a long New Yorker article two years ago, Joseph DePlasco, a spokesman for the city Department of Transportation, which owns the land, said the agency was taking ""a reformist position"" and had no plans to tear down the shanties. 
 Yesterday, Mr. DePlasco said the encampment had degenerated over the last year from a self-contained and self-sustaining community to one that was a threat to itself and the area around it. 
 ""There was more filth, it was more of an eyesore, there were sanitation problems,"" he said. 
 Concern began as long ago as May 1992, when an arson fire tore through the Hill, killing a long-time resident, Yi-Po Lee, and destroying 6 of the 15 or so structures, which were often lovingly constructed and outfitted with sofabeds, televisions and hotplates. 
 Since then, officials said neighbors had complained bitterly about an increase in drug use and sales in the camp -- a trade which some of its residents confirmed yesterday. Last Thursday evening, as workers from the city Human Resources Administration met with residents to tell them that their homes would be torn down, a drug-related shootout erupted in the settlement. 
 Early last week, after meetings among several city agencies, the Fire Department inspected the camp and issued an order to vacate the property on the grounds that it was a fire hazard. Michael Kharfen, director of the Mayor's Community Assistance Unit, said the decision was not aimed at the homeless themselves nor at shantytowns but at unsafe conditions.  Increase in People on Streets 
 ""We do look at each of these situations individually and very carefully and in this case the situation had deteriorated considerably,"" he said. ""We really determined that this was a serious and critical public safety and fire hazard."" 
 But Mr. Houghton, of the Coalition for the Homeless, and other advocates said the Hill's destruction was part of a continuing effort by Mayor David N. Dinkins to eradicate shantytowns and disperse the homeless into smaller, less noticeable pockets around the city, to minimize them as a political issue. 
 He said that a survey conducted by the Coalition last year found an increase in the number of people living on the streets not long after shanties and other, less permanent homeless communities were razed at places like 72d Street and the West Side Highway, Columbus Circle, the United Nations, Tompkins Square Park, Pennsylvania Station and near the Port Authority Bus Terminal. He said that more homeless people were also living in the boroughs outside of Manhattan. 
 While conceding that the Hill was a fire hazard, Mr. Houghton said his homeless organization only wanted more time to place more of its residents into assistance programs. 
 There were fewer than 25 people in the Hill's shanties when bulldozers and dump trucks arrived at 6 A.M. For five hours, city workers searched for remaining residents and collected some residents' possessions for safekeeping. Then the heavy equipment set to work, digging out huge scoops of worn jackets, twisted bicycles and splintered plywood. Wondering Where to Go 
 Destruction of one section was briefly halted after workers dismantling a hut by hand heard a man inside, warning them profanely to get away from his roof. The man apparently scurried out of the shack, down a slope toward the East River, and the hut was crushed. 
 All day, homeless men milled around the sidewalk across Canal Street complaining that their homes where being destroyed and wondering where they would go. One man said he would return to his wife in Brooklyn. Others said they would stay in Sara Delano Roosevelt Park, across the street from the Hill. Louis Watson, 52, was reunited with his white cat, Thomas, after the animal emerged from the debris. 
 Mr. Watson, who lived there for seven years, peeked past the dump trucks at the opened shell of the seven-foot high hut he built himself, mostly with materials he found on the streets. 
 ""It's been enjoyable here because you don't have to pay rent, you don't have the landlord harassing you,"" he said. ""You want to get drunk, you get drunk, whatever you want to do."" 
 The site will now be fenced in, and Mr. DePlasco said he hoped it would be turned into a community garden."
"167","Review/Film; A Loving Pair of Spies Take Baby to Work",633708,"|movies|arts",11,9,1993,"19930911T000000",NA," 
 Because it relies so heavily on manners identified with either the James Bond or ""Thin Man"" movies, you might suspect that ""Undercover Blues"" would be a sort of hybrid rip-off. The new film also uses New Orleans locations with the tenacity of a sightseer who won't rest until his feet bleed. The movie was made a year ago, but opened in New York theaters only yesterday. 
 Bad signs, all. 
 Possibly because of those signs, or at least in part, ""Undercover Blues"" turns out to seem a most genial surprise, a comic update of cold war espionage movies that, because of the New Orleans location, has the enhanced charm of a stolen holiday. It stars Kathleen Turner and Dennis Quaid, playing extremely well together, as Jane and Jeff Blue, who recall Nora and Nick Charles without making you wince. Jane and Jeff are wise-cracking, loving, incredibly adept American spies on maternity leave in New Orleans with their baby daughter in constant tow. 
 Exactly what agency might be employing Jane and Jeff is never clear, though they have apparently worked for both the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. When first met, they have just arrived in New Orleans to get away from it all. Jeff immediately makes a lifetime enemy of Muerte (Stanley Tucci), a vicious but hilariously incompetent mugger he calls Morty. 
 The next day they are enlisted to track down an international super-criminal named Novacek (Fiona Shaw), who was once the head of the secret police in Communist Czechoslovakia. The woman has apparently stolen a half-dozen containers of a new plastic explosive so dangerous that even the United States Army won't use it. It's beyond analyzing how Jane, Jeff, Muerte and Novacek all happen to come together for the frenetic climax in a Louisiana salt mine. Somehow they do. 
 Reason is beside the point of ""Undercover Blues,"" as written by Ian Abrams and directed by Herbert Ross. The movie has enough style to make you overlook reason and the occasionally erratic continuity. It also has moments of explosive comedy, not so arbitrarily set in the New Orleans zoo, a picturesque restaurant in the French Quarter and the old French Market. 
 From time to time the jolly banter between Jane and Jeff comes close to being twee, but often it is as laugh-out-loud funny as it means to be. Mr. Ross also manages to direct the scenes involving the baby in such a way that they are both very funny and crazily accurate. The baby, played by 11-month-old Michelle Schuelke, is a scene-stealer in the tradition of W. C. Fields's arch-foe, Baby LeRoy, and Robert Altman's grandson, Welsey Ivan Hurt, who played Swee' Pea in Mr. Altman's ""Popeye"" (1980). 
 Ms. Turner, a seriously funny comedienne, has her best role since ""The War of the Roses,"" though ""Undercover Blues"" itself is not in the same category. The laughs she gets are genuine. They don't come from a sit-com reading of the lines. Mr. Quaid seems to work harder to get the same results, maybe because he's required to smile too often. Ms. Shaw is not on the screen that much, but she's also a delight. Good support is given by Obba Babatunde and Larry Miller as two hopelessly outwitted New Orleans detectives. 
 This movie is a breeze. 
 ""Undercover Blues"" has been rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some mildly vulgar language and scenes that are sexually suggestive.  Undercover Blues

 It's two down and one to go among the republics that inherited nuclear arms when the Soviet Union broke up. Kazakhstan is about to follow Belarus's lead and get rid of its nuclear legacy. That leaves a lone holdout: stubborn Ukraine. 
 Ukraine has turned its tactical nuclear arms over to Russia for dismantling. And it's removing the warheads from aging SS-19 missiles. But President Leonid Kravchuk, who last year pledged to give up all of Ukraine's arms, now wants to keep some. The ones he has in mind, 46 intercontinental-range SS-24 missiles, were designed to target the U.S., and fly too far to strike most of Russia. 
 Ostensibly, Mr. Kravchuk is driving a hard bargain in an effort to win financial aid from the West. But his eagerness to appease Ukrainian nationalists could be a deal-stopper. 
 The nationalists see nuclear arms as a symbol of power and don't want to give them up. But nuclear weapons won't put food on the table. They're an expensive distraction from the true threat: the social unrest that's sure to follow if Ukraine's economy collapses. Unless Ukraine is prepared to spend billions it can't afford to pay for the infrastructure to control, re-target and maintain the warheads, they are a wasting asset. 
 Belarus and Kazakhstan understood that and knew the time had come to cut a deal. Belarus has begun to send its nuclear missiles back to Russia for dismantling. Washington has already provided financial inducements. The U.S. could also help things along by supporting Belarus's bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council. That would provide an important reminder to Ukraine and others that nuclear arms do not assure a seat at the head table. 
 Kazakhstan has agreed to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty by year's end. For its troubles it will get $140 million in economic aid and much, much more, like investment to develop its oil and natural gas, $85 million to help dismantle its nuclear arsenal and millions more to clean up the nuclear test site at Semipalatinsk. 
 Kazakhstan's President, Nursultan Nazarbayev, wants a face-to-face meeting with President Clinton to clinch the deal. President Kravchuk of Ukraine also wants a summit soiree in Washington before facing the electorate back home. But why give him one now? Rewarding Mr. Nazarbayev with a photo opportunity while denying one to Mr. Kravchuk would allow Mr. Clinton to show that the way to win Washington's favors is to disarm."
"171","Self-Rule Pact Is Major Challenge To Islamic Militant Group in Gaza",647912,"|world",7,11,1993,"19931107T000000","|MIDDLE EAST|ISRAEL|GAZA STRIP|JERICHO (ISRAELI-OCCUPIED TERRITORY)"," 
 On the day Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat shook hands in Washington to seal their peace pact, Atef Adwan sat bound and blindfolded in an Israeli Army detention center here as celebrations erupted in the streets. 
 ""I heard singing outside the jail, cheers from pro-Arafat prisoners and cries from the interrogation section,"" he recalled. 
 The date was Sept. 13. A reputed leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement, a Palestinian group better known as Hamas, Mr. Adwan had been held for a few days for questioning after returning from exile in southern Lebanon on Sept. 9. 
 He had come back with about half of nearly 400 accused Islamic militants who had been expelled from the territories by Israel in December after a series of deadly attacks by Palestinians. Israel has agreed to allow the rest of the deportees to return by the end of this year. Palestinian Flags Everywhere 
 When he finally got home, Mr. Adwan, who teaches political science and history at Islamic University in Gaza, found a changed city. Palestinian flags flew everywhere, buildings were plastered with pictures of Mr. Arafat and thousands of his supporters were holding rallies and marches. Followers of Mr. Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization dominated the streets. 
 Hamas, which vehemently opposes peace with Israel, was thrown on the defensive. 
 The agreement on Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho is a serious challenge to Hamas, whose popularity had grown here as despair had deepened during nearly two years of fruitless Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Though Hamas militants have kept up a steady barrage of sometimes fatal attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians in an effort to scuttle the Israeli-Palestinian agreement, the movement is in a political quandary. P.L.O. Legitimized 
 With preparations under way for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and with P.L.O. followers promoting what they say is their first achievement on the ground in the occupied territories, Hamas has been forced to adjust to a new political landscape in which Israel has legitimized the P.L.O. and expects to cooperate with the group against Islamic militants. 
 Israel has tolerated the opening of offices in the territories by Fatah, the mainstream faction of the P.L.O., where men and women have been enlisting in a planned Palestinian police force. Notices signed by Fatah and its youth movement, Shabiba, appear in the Palestinian press, uncensored by Israel. 
 Hamas leaders say they worry that the P.L.O will use its authority under a future self-governing arrangement to repress its Islamic opponents, as the secular governments of Egypt and Algeria do. 
 They warn that the Palestinian police, trained in Egypt and Jordan, might duplicate methods used in those countries against Islamic fundamentalists. And they predict possible clashes if the police try to block attacks by Hamas gunmen on Israeli troops and settlers. 
 ""The question is whether the police will serve the people or will be used against the people, as in Egypt or Algeria,"" said Salem Salamah, another returning deportee, who is dean of academic affairs at the Islamic University. 
 ""I'm concerned that our graduates may be refused government jobs and our people will be denied licenses and permits because we are from the opposition,"" he added. Conciliatory Voices 
 Although Hamas leaflets vow an unrelenting struggle against the plan for self-rule and urge Palestinians to step up attacks on Israeli soldiers and settlers, some voices are more conciliatory, apparently reflecting a desire not to be excluded from the new political order emerging in the territories. 
 Sheik Hamed al-Bitawi, a leading Islamic cleric who also recently returned from exile in Lebanon, was recently quoted in a Palestinian newspaper as saying that ""we do not oppose the P.L.O.'s efforts to recover part of our country,"" though he insisted that ""no part of Palestine"" could be given up. 
 Mr. Adwan said Hamas might take part in the elections planned in the territories for next year, provided that the voting was for ""a Government and Parliament with authority to set policy."" Mr. Salamah said Hamas could join a self-governing council if it were assured of proportional representation of 45 percent, a figure that he said would reflect Hamas's strength among the people. 
 But even if Hamas did boycott the elections, Mr. Adwan added, the movement could still be active as a political party, offering Palestinians an alternative to the arrangement for self-government and aligning itself with secular opposition groups.  Other Elections 
 Hamas leaders say that if they shun the vote for a self-governing council, they could still run in municipal elections and compete for the leadership of professional associations, unions, chambers of commerce and student councils on which Islamic representatives have made gains in recent years. Even in defeat they have often drawn between 35 to 45 percent of the vote. 
 On the grass-roots level, Hamas leaders hope to maintain their movement's influence, which has been built through a growing network of social service organizations aided by financing from Saudi Arabia, other gulf Arab states and Iran. Hamas has used Islamic welfare groups to win support, especially in the impoverished Gaza Strip, where it has filled gaps left by inadequate Government services. 
 Islamic associations run kindergartens and summer camps. They give food and money to poor families, provide clothing and financial aid to orphans and needy pupils and have organized cleanup and home repair campaigns in refugee neighborhoods. One group in Gaza appealed this week for donations to families whose houses were recently rocketed by Israeli troops searching for armed fugitives. 
 ""Our actions speak louder than 100 mosque sermons,"" said Ibrahim al-Yazuri, a pharmacist who leads Al-Mujama al-Islami, an Islamic group founded in Gaza in the 1970's. Hamas, a militant offshoot of Al-Mujama al-Islami, emerged when the Palestinian uprising began in the occupied territories in December 1987."

"173","Why Small Powers Also Deserve Respect",651705,"|opinion",22,11,1993,"19931122T000000",NA," 
 To the Editor: 
 W. Anthony Lake, the President's national security adviser, has appealed to opinion makers and Congress to keep making a distinction between the immediate and the important when dealing with the ""less strategically significant questions"" of small countries that are ripping themselves apart like Somalia and Haiti. He might also include Angola, Armenia, Bosnia and others. 
 The distinction between the immediate and the important incorrectly associates the security issue of small nations in internal turmoil with the immediate but unimportant, compared with ""the most fundamental questions"" of areas of greater strategic importance to us, like Russia. 
 In an American policy of engagement, based on democratic principles and pragmatic application of American power, there is no escaping responsibility for the security problems of small countries. The big strategic issues will be those like demilitarization of Russia and countering strategic weapons proliferation from China. But democratization and defense of more than 100 small countries are issues of the first magnitude. 
 Small country security issues are of first importance to the security of most large countries, particularly when the small countries ripping themselves apart are on the borders of the large countries and involve ethnic or religious groups. Don't forget that most of the great power wars were initiated by disputes in small states within their competing spheres of influence -- Bosnia in 1914, Czechoslovakia in 1938, Korea in 1951, Kuwait in 1990. 
 The best efforts of the nuclear powers at counterproliferation of weapons of mass destruction are unlikely to be completely successful in denying desperate small countries, rich drug cartels and crime syndicates access to nuclear weapons. 
 The increasing number of small country security crises affecting the national security of the great powers means that there must be a wider choice of policy options than costly and often futile armed intervention or withdrawal into military and economic isolationism. 
 Fortunately there are examples of small countries that have successfully resolved their internal conflicts and defended their independence against much stronger neighbors without themselves becoming threatening to others. Slovenia, Finland, Switzerland and Costa Rica are such good examples. Perhaps Estonia and Israel soon may be. 
 The Clinton Administration cannot evade or postpone responsibility for a viable and consistent foreign policy and security strategy concerning small country conflicts by arguing that policies concerning great powers are more strategically significant. An effective foreign and defense policy will regard both as important and address both seriously and simultaneously.  CLARK ABT  Director, Defense Technology Conversion Center, Boston U.

"174","Review/Music; A Chorus Out on Its Own",655194,"|arts",11,12,1993,"19931211T000000",NA," 
 When the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra perform choral works, they generally call on the services of the Westminster Choir. But although the performances have given the choir considerable visibility, its director, Joseph Flummerfelt, is usually left sitting on the sidelines, having trained his singers in the works at hand and then passed them over to the orchestra's conductor for the performance. 
 Mr. Flummerfelt was on the podium at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday evening to conduct his remarkably well-polished chorus in a Christmas concert. Yet he did not keep the spotlight to himself. Among his soloists was Jennifer Larmore, a mezzo-soprano who was once a member of the choir and who has lately become a hot property in the worlds of opera and recital. Inevitably, attention was focused on her, and Mr. Flummerfelt gave her ample opportunity to shine in arias from Bach's ""Christmas Oratorio,"" Handel's ""Messiah,"" the Brahms Alto Rhapsody and Adolphe Adam's ""O Holy Night."" 
 Miss Larmore's sound is dark, beautifully focused and powerful enough to project in the hall with little apparent effort. Her style, at least in this music, was elegant and sober, closer to the reasoned maturity of Janet Baker than to the brighter, more overtly dramatic approach of Cecilia Bartoli or Marilyn Horne. Her Brahms was ravishing, and her accounts of Handel's ""But Who May Abide"" and ""O Thou That Tellest Good Tidings to Zion"" were invigorating not for their assertiveness but for their inner serenity. 
 There were also fine solo contributions from Mark Bleeke, a tenor, in the Bach, and William Powers, a baritone, in the Handel. In seasonal favorites (""O Come All Ye Faithful,"" ""Silent Night"" and ""The First Noel"") as well as excerpts from more ambitious works (including Berlioz's ""Enfance du Christ,"" Mendelssohn's ""Christus"" and Bach's Mass in B minor), Mr. Flummerfelt drew a velvety, perfectly blended sound from his 40-voice choir.

"176","Clash on Fossil Sales Shadows a Trade Fair",669000,"|science|health",15,2,1994,"19940215T000000","|TUCSON (ARIZ)"," 
 THERE was something for everyone: $5 fossil sea urchins for customers on tight budgets, museum-quality dinosaur skeletons at prices up to $1.1 million and hundreds of thousands of other fossils of all types and values. 
 But as crowds packed the Tucson Minerals and Fossils Show last week to ogle the paleontological treasure on sale, Federal officials were looking for new ways to crack down on fossil trading. 
 Thousands of commercial dealers, collectors, museum agents and fossil buffs from many nations filled the hotels and motels of Tucson, where the annual show spread out over many square miles. 
 Hundreds of hotel rooms, banquet halls and meeting rooms were converted into private museums during the week for an event that has become the largest trade fair for fossil dealers throughout the world. Eye-popping fossils from China, Germany, England, Spain, Morocco, Lebanon and many other countries joined a wealth of fossils from America's badlands and bluffs in the big sale. 
 But it was a trade fair steeped in dispute, bitterness and litigation, with commercial dealers claiming a legitimate right to hunt, collect and sell fossils, while Government agencies and some paleontologists strive to halt the trade. 
 Commenting on the current boom in fossil sales and prices, Dr. William S. Clemens, a professor of paleontology at the University of California at Berkeley, and the president of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, said: ""I've been visiting the exhibits at the Tucson show this year to get a feeling for the trade, and some of the things I saw made me sick. I saw some exhibits marked with numbers similar to those used by museums, and I couldn't help wondering whether these specimens had been looted from museums. I saw a rare fossil amphibian from Russia on sale, accompanied by a certificate from Russia's Paleontological Institute allowing export of this treasure. The Russians must certainly be hard up to let things like that go."" 
 Although many a deal was done, the trading this year took place under a legal cloud that could send some prominent fossil dealers to jail for terms of hundreds of years. With the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service and other Federal agencies breathing down the necks of America's fossil collectors, dealers here were taking pains to avoid even the hint of wrongdoing. 
 Several criminal cases are pending against fossil dealers, and the Justice Department is seeking fresh evidence for use in prosecutions. Meanwhile, fossil dealers who gathered for the Tucson show, many of whom described recent Government initiatives as a ""witch hunt,"" were organizing to defend themselves by legal action, perhaps aided by a Washington-based lobby. The charges and implications levied against the dinosaur dealers are serious. Hints of Crime Links 
 Dr. Dan Chure, a National Park Service paleontologist at Dinosaur National Monument in Utah, said in an interview that the Colombian drug cartels might have become interested in acquiring valuable stolen fossils that disappear from museums or private estates. John Kundts, a spokesman for the F.B.I. in Washington, said that the prices of fossils, particularly those of dinosaurs, had become high enough to attract criminal notice. 
 Fossil dealers here angrily deny implications that their businesses have any ties to organized crime, and have accused Government agencies of slandering them. 
 Federal agencies, spurred to action by opponents of commercial fossil collecting, have undertaken a costly campaign against some fossil dealers who sell their wares to museums, corporations and private collectors in many countries. Targets of this campaign could eventually include educational and scientific institutions that have acquired fossils from dealers, and officials of museums in several countries are uneasy. 
 A Federal indictment issued last November named the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago as buyers of fossils excavated illegally from Federal lands. Karen E. Schreier, United States Attorney for South Dakota, where the indictment was issued, said in an interview that she did not intend to prosecute either museum because they had cooperated with investigators. 
 But dealers here said that museums in Europe that had lent many fossils to American institutions were worried that future action by the Federal Government was unpredictable, and that Federal officials might even seize collections on loan from abroad. Several European museums are therefore recalling their specimens from American museums. Concern About Questionnaire 
 Some American curators are also uneasy about a questionnaire that will soon be circulated by the National Park Service requesting an accounting by museums of all archeological and scientific materials in their collections ""obtained through relationships with Federal agencies such as permits and contracts."" Although response to the questionnaire is voluntary, some museum officials fear the results of the survey could become the basis of Federal legal actions against some institutions. 
 The large investment the Government has made in prosecuting fossil dealers has awed collectors, scientists and museum officials. 
 The storm center of the dispute is the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research Inc. of Hill City, S.D., and its officers, who, under the Federal indictment issued last November could each face long prison sentences and fines for illegally collecting and selling fossils excavated from Federal land. The case involves the bones of a tyrannosaur, nicknamed ""Sue."" 
 According to Gary G. Colbath, one of the defense lawyers involved, the Justice Department has already spent $4.5 million preparing its complex case against the Black Hills Institute and its president, Peter Larson. The preparation has included repeated raids on the Black Hills workshop, a fact-finding mission to Japan, where museums have bought fossils from the company, and the deployment of scores of Federal agents and National Guardsmen. 
 Professional paleontologists are divided in their opinions about commercial fossil dealing in general and the Larson case in particular. 
 Dr. Robert M. Hunt, a paleontologist at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, has spearheaded a drive to restrict the activities of commercial collectors, and has expressed delight at Mr. Larson's indictment. 
 ""Unfortunately,"" he said in an interview, ""the abuse of America's fossil resources by these dealers is getting worse than ever. I can only hope that a public outcry against this assault on the resources of science and the American people will help to halt trafficking in priceless fossils."" 
 A milder view was expressed by Dr. Clemens. ""It comes down to a sense of responsibility,"" he said.  ""Many collectors have worked closely with scientists and museums, to their mutual benefit. Large museums have their own resources and staffs, but what's a small museum to do if it wants to acquire some good specimens? I think we must encourage large institutions to reach out and help smaller museums, and that has begun to happen."" 
 Dr. John Maisey, an English ichthyologist and paleontologist at New York City's Museum of Natural History, declared: ""This whole campaign by the Federal cops against the fossil business is ridiculous, considering all the murderers out there that remain to be caught. If they really want to stop the under-the-counter fossil trade, they should legalize it on Federal land, and regulate the practice, as governments in Europe do. This assures scientists and museums of access to important fossils, but allows a legitimate trade to exist."" 
 Many of the items displayed at this year's show represent close collaboration between commercial dealers and scientists. 
 In the Quality Inn lobby in Tucson, Michael Triebold, a dealer from Valley City, N.D., set up a 20-foot-long, freestanding articulated fossil of a Xiphactinus audax, a meat-eating fish with huge jaws and teeth, that lived at the time of the dinosaurs. The fossil is shown being attacked by a fossil mosasaur, a large reptile predator of the shallow Cretaceous seas. Both are casts of the original fossils, which were collected in Kansas. Sharing the Profits 
 ""You don't have to hunt on Federal lands to find good fossils,"" Mr. Triebold said. ""I enter into a partnership with landowners, and if we find and excavate fossils, the landowners share in the profits of the sales."" 
 In some regions, plots of federally owned land are interspersed with private land, and since there are no markers or fences, it is difficult to know which is which. 
 ""I take no chances,"" Mr. Triebold said. ""I use a Global Positioning System satellite receiver to locate sites of interest. But a G.P.S. measurement may be off by several hundred yards, and when there is any doubt, I hire a surveyor to locate the boundary between Federal and private land."" 
 The treasures found by Mr. Triebold's company are rich beyond the dreams of many museums. In his little showroom here, he displayed the leg bone of a triceratops dinosaur collected in South Dakota, which he calls a ""Rex Biscuit."" It is perforated by the daggerlike teeth of a tyrannosaur's jaw, and it is deeply gouged by the fangs of lesser carnivores that scavenged the leavings of the tyrannosaur's meal 65 million years ago. Mr. Triebold sells casts of this remarkable specimen for $850 each. Although he prefers to sell casts, he would sell the leg bone, incorporated into a complete triceratops skeleton, for $500,000. 
 Most of the deals here involve the sale of casts rather than original fossils, and dealers say that some 90 percent of the customers are museums. But for institutions or people with deep purses, some original fossils are available that would make any museum curator drool. 
 Geological Enterprises Inc., of Ardmore, Okla., for example, is now cleaning and preparing an extremely rare fossil of an Acrocanthosaurus atokensis, a member of the carnivorous allosaur family that grew to enormous size in the early Cretaceous period. With a skull five feet seven inches long, this is the second largest carnivorous dinosaur ever found, following the tyrannosaur itself. 
 The company hopes to begin selling casts of the completed skull soon, but it would sell the entire fossil, prepared and mounted, if a suitable buyer is found. ""The price is $1.1 million, take it or leave it,"" said Leon Theisen, whose South Dakota shop is preparing the fossil. ""Naturally, we would try to sell it only to a museum or scientific institution."" 
 Paleontologists are sharply critical of some fossil dealers who cut up dinosaur fossils to make decorative objects or jewelry, but some of these dealers defend the practice by saying they only use bone that has been broken up already and spoiled for scientific study. 
 At one of the stands here, a company in Moab, Utah, The Look of the Past, offered earrings and pendants made of dinosaur bone that had mineralized into agate. But along with the jewelry, the company displayed an allosaur leg bone reassembled from its broken parts and then sliced in two with a diamond saw. The exposed stone surfaces were highly polished, revealing a blazing pattern of colored agate that highlights the cell structure of the big dinosaur's bone tissue and marrow. Its price was $8,000. 
 But despite the high prices of some fossils, ""none of us get rich, and you won't find any fancy cars around here,"" said Dr. Raymond J. Boyce, a retired South Dakota urologist who has collected fossils all his life. Dr. Boyce's son Japheth now heads the fossil dealership he founded in Rapid City, S.D. ""The money people pay is not for the fossils, which cost nothing,"" he said. ""It's for the months of hard searching and the study and craftsmanship needed to separate these fossils from the matrix rock and prepare them properly and look after them scientifically -- that's what people pay for. 
 ""The Government called me before the grand jury to testify, and maybe it's getting ready to put me in jail, too,"" Dr. Boyce said. ""Here we've been working as partners with our Indian neighbors for as long as anyone can remember, finding fossils, enjoying them, showing them and giving them to museums and sometimes selling them. I bought fossils from Ed Two Bulls Sr. himself, a descendant of Sitting Bull. And now the Federal Government wants to jail us all. I tell you, this country is changing in ways I hate to see."" 
 His son Japheth nodded grimly. ""We don't have money to do much yet, but we're trying to organize a new group, the Earth Sciences Trade Association, to fight back and sue the people who slander us. We're not dead yet."""
"177","Sports of The Times; Nancy Smiles While Tonya Hits Town",669482,"|sports",18,2,1994,"19940218T000000",NA," 
 WHY is this woman smiling? I mean, grinning from ear to ear. She smiles when she is warming up. She smiles when she is practicing. She smiles when her coaches loudly clap their hands after her every move. 
 Nancy Kerrigan was even smiling when her old friend Tonya Harding went down in a pile against the boards as if she had been forechecked by Bob Probert or Tie Domi or the big bopper from the Portland Kneewhackers, Shane Stant himself. But there was nobody in sight, just some invisible poltergeist maybe trying to even things up for the ugly event in the nationals in Detroit. 
 That did not necessarily mean Kerrigan was smiling at Harding's misfortune. She just smiles all the time, like a baby with gas. Who knew all this waiting was such giddy fun? But Kerrigan seems determined to have a grand old time here at the Winter Games, as if practice were an endless commercial shoot. And probably it is. 
 Kerrigan did her best not to notice the presence of her pal yesterday on the exact six-week anniversary of Kerrigan's being whacked on the knee by a thug hired by Harding's former husband. It was hard not to notice Harding flitting back and forth on the ice during the two practice sessions that were open to six skaters at a time. 
 Harding seemed much less inhibited than Kerrigan about where she could go. There was something primal about the way Harding staked out every corner of the rink, but wherever Kerrigan's averted gaze went, her face was curled up in a giant ""aren't we having fun?"" smile. 
 Now, anybody who has ever run a race knows the rush of positive energy that comes from willing the face muscles from a fatigued grimace to a joyous smile. There is a lot of smiling in this sport, or whatever it is. Figure skaters learn to smile in public after some judge has stuck it to them, when the logical thing would be to shake a fist and talk trash. 
 It is also true that skaters must display neat warm-up costumes and makeup and happy smiles during practice because the judges are making mental notes about who's got it and who doesn't. Kerrigan's support system -- her coaches, Evy and Mary Scotvold, two of the most positive and experienced people in the business -- are doing the right thing by smiling and clapping like some hired opera claque. 
 It's part of the game. 
 But smiling could become a chore for Nancy Kerrigan. Tonya's here. Tonya's not going away. Time is on Tonya's side. Tonya is a survivor. Tonya has survived her chaotic family life, and she has survived the legal skirmishes when the United States Olympic Committee tried to haul her in for questioning about her role in the most celebrated knee-whacking in sports history. 
 Harding even survived her long haul from Portland, performing the difficult Portland-Seattle-Copenhagen-Oslo triple axel, and after one night in Europe she went out to practice yesterday, nine time zones out of kilter. But Tonya is on record that she does not believe in jet lag. Her life seems uncluttered by awareness of many things. She probably wonders why everybody is making such a big fuss over a fourth-rate knee-whacking. 
 She never seemed to notice the hundreds of reporters and photographers milling about the tiny practice rink yesterday. Tonya knows what she needs. She needs a nasal inhalator for her asthma. She needs a smoke and a cold brew. And she needs to make some money. She doesn't smile much. Life's too hard. 
 Tonya was definitely not smiling at the end of her afternoon workout, when she tried a triple axel at the end of her short practice and wound up sprawled on the ice. She skated one-legged for a while, displaying no Kerriganesque smiles, and she even made a few jumps at the end of practice. The trainer scooped up a bucketful of snow from the endless supply just outside the door, to be applied to her ""chronically sore ankle,"" as it was described. Tonya was limping when she left the building. She will be back. She's not going away -- certainly not easily. 
 That leaves Nancy Kerrigan with a smile on her face. Kerrigan did nothing to deserve being whacked in the knee on Jan. 6 -- nothing except be in Tonya Harding's way, at least in the twisted reasoning of the four louts who plotted and committed the attack. Harding insists she had nothing to do with the plot, and perhaps she will never be charged with anything. It may not be fair to make Kerrigan work out in the same sextet with her competitor who has links to the goons who whacked Nancy Kerrigan, but life is not fair. Tonya is in Norway. Tonya's at the Winter Games. 
 And Nancy Kerrigan is smiling."

 ARTHUR MILLER PREMIERE 
 The premiere of Arthur Miller's new play ""Broken Glass,"" opens at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven March 9, with previews beginning on Tuesday. Ron Rifkin, Amy Irving and Ron Silver have the leading roles, and John Tillinger is the director. Rounding out the cast of six are Frances Conroy, Lauren Klein and George N. Martin. 
 The title was taken from Kristallnacht, or night of the shattered glass, when a 48-hour pogrom took place throughout Germany, in which Jews, their homes and businesses were destroyed on Nov. 9 and 10, 1938. It brought to a head the systematic persecution of Jews that began with a 1933 law dismissing them from government service and from the universities, and prohibiting them from entering the professions. 
 ""Broken Glass"" is set in Brooklyn in 1938, where Sylvia and Phillip Gelburg, portrayed by Ms. Irving and Mr. Rifkin, struggle with a mysterious paralysis that has overtaken her and is somehow connected to events taking place in Germany. Ron Silver plays the doctor to whom they turn for help and who becomes deeply entangled in their lives. 
 Performance times are Tuesday at 7 P.M., Wednesday through Friday at 8 P.M., Saturday at 4 and 8:30 P.M., and Sunday at 2 and 7 P.M. Tickets are $24.50 to $34; preview tickets are $19 and $21. The box office number is 787-4282. CELEBRATING TIBET 
 Beginning on Tuesday, the Venerable Lobsang Samten, a Tibetan Buddhist monk, will spend a month creating a multicolored sand mandala, six feet in diameter and two inches deep, on the floor of the Windener Gallery in the Austin Arts Center of Trinity College in Hartford. Visitors are welcome to watch him work, Monday through Friday from 10 to 4. When the mandala is completed it will be ceremoniously swept up and disposed of in the Connecticut River. 
 The project is central to a series of events continuing through March 24, exploring the sacred arts of Tibet. The idea evolved from a request by Elena Fischbacher, a senior at Trinity, to include the making of a mandala, the symbolic circular design that is used in religious art and meditation, as part of her thesis on Tibetan Buddhist art forms. 
 The month-long celebration was organized with the assistance of a new Tibetan refugee community in Old Saybrook. A reception will be held on Monday from 4 to 6 P.M. for the Venerable Lobsang Samten and his assistant. 
 Some of the subsequent events include a lecture on Tuesday at 8 P.M. by Marilyn Rhie, a professor at Smith College, on ""The Mystic Realm: The Mandala in Buddhist Art,"" and on Saturday from noon to 4 P.M. a full-blown Tibetan bazaar will take place, replete with merchants, arts and crafts demonstrations, concerts and dance performances. 
 ""The Mystical Arts of Tibet: Sacred Music, Sacred Dance"" will be performed on Saturday at 8 P.M. by the monks of Drepung Loseling Monastery in the college's Goodwin Theater. Admission will be $8, or $5 for students and the elderly. Most other events are free. The number for a complete schedule is 297-2199. MUSEUM GUIDE 
 One of the Connecticut Historical Society's contributions to black history month is a just-published guide to some 1,200 objects, books and other reference material in its museum and library at 1 Elizabeth Street in Hartford. 
 The guide, which took two years to complete, is called ""An Annotated Guide to Sources for the Study of African-American History in the Museum and Library Collections of the Connecticut Historical Society."" It contains 251 pages listing photographs, textiles, toys, cartoons, children's books, prints, letters, account books and advertising cards, among other resources. 
 It is the first such guide to be published by the society and is available for $20 in the society's bookstore. A copy is accessible to the public in the library for a fee of $3, or free to society members and to students with identification. The number for more information is 236-5621. MAPLE SYRUP TIME 
 Warrups Farm in West Redding will be open to visitors during the first three weekends in March for the making of maple syrup. Each Saturday and Sunday Bill Hill, the farmer, will be in the log sugarhouse cooking the sap and making syrup and candy from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. 
 Visitors who happen to arrive when the sap is running may trudge around outdoors to some of the 200 trees being tapped, viewing a process for collecting the liquid the easy way -- by gravity. Trees located on a hillside discharge sap into tubes that run down the hill and empty into tubs. 
 Tracking the weather for warm sunny days and chilly nights is the way to predict a good sap-running day. Fresh syrup and maple sugar candies will be for sale, and the farm keeps a number of barnyard animals, many of which are amenable to petting. There are ducks, geese and turkeys, a donkey, sheep, pigs and Scottish Highland cattle. 
 Mud boots are essential, whether tramping out to the trees or traversing the 125-foot path of snow-softened earth from the dirt road to the sugarhouse. The address is John Read Road, 1.2 miles north of Redding Center, off Route 107 and opposite the Redding Country Club. Admission is free and the phone number for more information is 938-9403. 
 Anyone interested in sugarhouses elsewhere in the state can write to the Connecticut Department of Agriculture, Marketing Division, State Office Building, 165 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, 06106, for a free 1994 guide to 200 sugarhouses. Enclose a stamped, self-addressed legal-sized envelope. MAKING CAREER CHOICES 
 Girls of middle school age and their parents are invited to take part in a career workshop offering a total of 17 workshops, from which each participant may choose three. The event, titled Choices Unlimited, is scheduled on Saturday from 8:30 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. at Central Middle School in Greenwich. Two of the workshops are geared for adults, focusing on how to help girls make career choices and financial planning for college. 
 The purpose of the session is to encourage middle school girls to investigate the opportunities open to them, paving the way for an informed selection of courses in high school. Among the 17 careers to be discussed are architecture, banking, television production, publishing, journalism, chemistry, engineering, medicine and graphic design. Each presenter is a professional in his or her field who brings some of the tools of the trade to demonstrate, whether a veterinarian, an interior designer or a fitness trainer. 
 Sponsors include the Greenwich Board of Education, League of Women Voters, American Association of University Women, National Organization for Women, and others. Admission is $3 and advance registration is recommended. For more information, 629-1554. ELEANOR CHARLES"
"179","Q&A",671660,"|science|health",1,3,1994,"19940301T000000",NA," 
 Heart Muscle Q. What is special about the heart muscle that keeps it from getting tired? 
 A. The heart muscle is a special hard-working kind found nowhere else in the body, though it can get very tired when deprived of oxygen in a heart attack and can get stronger through exercise, explains Dr. Mark V. Barrow in ""Heart Talk: Understanding Cardiovascular Diseases"" (Cor-Ed Publishing Company). 
 The other types of muscle are skeletal or striated muscle, the kind that lets the body move voluntarily, and smooth muscle, found in internal organs and the walls of blood vessels, which is arranged in sheets and is not under conscious control. 
 The heart muscle, or myocardium, is called a synctial muscle or synctium, because its strands are so interconnected that they form a continous network of cells. This lets internal electrical signals be coordinated so the whole muscle acts as a unit, contracting or relaxing together. In fact, according to ""Gray's Anatomy,"" the heart was once thought not to be composed of individual cells. 
 The cells of the heart muscle, or myocardium, have their nuclei buried deep within, rather than near the surface like those of skeletal muscle. They also have an abundance of large mitochondria, the energy factories inside cells, presumably because of high energy demands. 
 The cells are arranged in parallel columns, as in skeletal muscle, but in still another difference from other muscle cells, heart cells are joined end to end in very long fibers that branch and interconnect. The joining sites are marked by disks called intercalated disks. In between the fibers are spaces richly supplied with capillaries to supply oxygenated blood. The cells also enjoy a good supply of glycogen and lipids, potential energy sources. 
 Inside the cells are myofibrils, a banded contractile substance. The myofibrils have zones called sarcomeres, where thin filaments made of a substance called actin and thick filaments made of myosin contract and relax. The filaments slide by each other as they act. Potato Damage 
 Q. How does a black mildew or rusty substance get to the center of a potato without damaging the flesh around it? 
 A. If the damage actually comes from mildew, a fungus, it is possible to see an entry point in the vascular system of the potato, just under the skin, the same kind of network of veins seen in the leaf and stem, said William E. Fry, professor of plant pathology at the Cornell College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. 
 But there are many other sources of potato damage, said Dr. Elmer Ewing, professor of fruit and vegetable science at the agriculture school. One is black heart, a result of oxygen deficiency. 
 The potato continues to use oxygen in storage, he explained, and at high temperatures, it uses oxygen at a faster rate. Storage with potatoes that are rotting can cause a ""hot spot"" that accelerates the process. The damage is worse at the center of the potato because it is farthest from the surface, where oxygen normally diffuses in from outside to replace what is used. 
 Still another problem is hollow heart, which occurs if a potato grows too fast. The tissues at the center pull apart, then ""cork over"" with a brown layer in an attempt to heal by growing a skin-like layer. It is unattractive but harmless. ""Some potato growers call it the butter hole,"" Dr. Ewing said. C. CLAIBORNE RAY"
"180","Oregon Concern's Workers Learn and Earn",673857,"|business",12,3,1994,"19940312T000000",NA," 
 Many executives espouse the need for American businesses to provide better job-related training for their employees, but few deal with the issue as directly as Richard Gordon. 
 Mr. Gordon, the president of a small Portland auto parts company, pays his 22 employees to read books like M. Scott Peck's ""The Road Less Traveled,"" listen to tapes by DePak Chopra or watch self-improvement videos. 
 The concern, the IPD Company, is the leading North American purveyor of after-market parts for Volvos and an innovator in suspension kits for big vehicles, like motor homes, buses and rescue vehicles. 
 In addition to devising the ""Learn and Earn"" program, Mr. Gordon added a library to the company's lunchroom to accommodate it. Hunger for Knowledge 
 ""It isn't my job to force employees to learn, but to create an atmosphere that encourages continuous learning,"" Mr. Gordon said. ""The more knowledge you have, the more knowledge you want."" Still, some reading is required. 
 This year, for the first time, he has given the managers a list of required books and videos. ""Managers have to set the example,"" he said. And ""The Power of Ethical Management,"" for example, by the late Rev. Norman Vincent Peale, must be read by every new worker within 90 days of being hired. 
 The company has hundreds of books and tapes that employees can read or listen to on their own time, earning an average of $25 for each in their paychecks -- the payments range from $5 to $40, depending on the book or tape. Employees can also apply to go to approved seminars at company expense. The kicker is that they must write the equivalent of a book report, which is stored in a three-ring binder in the lunchroom. Mr. Gordon makes it a point to read each report.  Lack of Formal Education 
 Mr. Gordon emphasizes self-education because that is the path he took. Mr. Gordon and his wife, Judy, married the summer they were graduated from high school in 1960. By the time he started his business in 1963, they had three children. He took a number of short self-improvement courses like vocabulary, typing and speed reading, but he had no time for further formal education. 
 Few of his employees have had much formal education, either. In more than 30 years in business, he can recall only three workers who had college degrees. 
 Even so, many employees take advantage of the program. Mr. Gordon conceded that some do so without great enthusiasm, but one became so motivated that he enrolled in night school and wrote Mr. Gordon a glowing letter thanking him for putting him on a path of personal growth. Books Open Windows 
 ""Stimulating brains works to the organization's benefit,"" Mr. Gordon said. ""I found that my own ability to deal with people and handle my work improved through the reading I did. Every book I read gives me a different window to look through. It made sense that the others here could improve themselves and the company if they were exposed to the same information."" 
 The books Mr. Gordon recommends to his employees include ""The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People,"" by Steven Covey; ""Notes to Myself,"" by Hugh Prather, and ""The Empowered Manager,"" by Peter Block. 
 Mr. Gordon said a desire to learn, hard work, imagination and taking calculated risks could be more important than formal education in the business world.  COMPANY NEWS"

 As ""One for the Road With Charles Kuralt and Morley Safer"" gets started, Mr. Safer says, ""This is not a tribute."" But that is exactly what it is, of course, on the occasion of Mr. Kuralt's departure, after 37 years, from CBS News. 
 In a conversation in the New York Public Library, Mr. Kuralt is given an opportunity to tell how much he admires the little folks whom he celebrated in ""On the Road,"" his long-running feature on the ""CBS Evening News."" The encounter also gives CBS an opportunity to recycle clips of his meetings with, among others, an Iowa farmer who built a yacht for himself; an Arkansas man with a third-grade education who put together an impressive library so his children would be educated; a tenant farmer in Mississippi whose nine children all worked for and obtained college degrees, and a worm-grunting specialist in Sopchoppy, Fla. (To grunt a worm is to annoy it enough to get it to the surface where it can be grabbed and used as bait.) 
 Mr. Kuralt's spirit has generally seemed a bit effusive for my taste, his tone more hearty than strictly required and his prose a touch ripe.

But as a television personality, he has earned the admiration that Mr. Safer displays tonight for his willingness to wander around small towns doing what he calls ""innocent little features"" and for the attention he paid to the arts during his 15 years on ""CBS News Sunday Morning."" 
 He has demonstrated that even on a ratings-driven network there can be room for programs that are not likely to appeal to much of the prime-time mob. Presumably Mr. Kuralt made money for CBS or he would not have been allowed to go his own way for so long. May such efforts continue to prosper. 
 It is reassuring to learn tonight that there are things that make the upbeat wanderer angry, especially ""all those people who came along who know how you and I should live our lives: the health police."" He declares that he has no intention of jogging and will continue to smoke cigars. Hey, CBS News, how about offering the man a new job: a chance to do his stuff on people, institutions and fads he can't stand? One for the Road With Charles Kuralt and Morley Safer

 Beginning an investigation into a possible misuse of Federal, state and city funds, United States postal agents yesterday confiscated reams of files from the headquarters of a Brooklyn school district and from a private Hasidic school within the district, officials said. 
 More than a dozen agents of the Postal Inspection Service descended on the two sites of the United Talmudical Academy of Williamsburg and the main office of Community School District 14, seizing files and sealing the door to the district's headquarters. 
 The raid marked the start of a joint investigation by the United States Attorney for the Eastern District and the city school system's Special Commissioner of Investigations into possible misuse of Federal money for poor children known as Chapter 1 aid, said an official familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity. Investigators will also be searching for possible misuse of city and state funds from the Board of Education, the official said. 
 Outside District 14's offices at 215 Heyward Street in Williamsburg yesterday, postal agents wheeled out boxes and whole file cabinets, stacking them in cars and an Express Mail truck. Computers, packed in plastic and covered with stickers marked ""Evidence,"" were also carted off. Telephone calls to District 14 officials yesterday were not returned. 
 Federal agents also seized files from the Talmudical Academy's two locations, Bnos Yakov and Samet MH Rabbi, at 62 Harrison Avenue, and 253 Keap Street, a spokesman for the academy said. Tensions in District 
 District 14, which spans the Williamsburg and Greenpoint sections of Brooklyn, has been rocked by tensions between its majority white school board, whose members are supported by the Orthodox Jewish community and the Catholic Church, and the black and Hispanic population whose children are the majority in the district's public schools. 
 Although most Hasidic children attend private schools, they receive Federal and state money through the public school district. In particular, Hasidic schools in Williamsburg rely heavily on Chapter 1 funds for English and math education. 
 Chapter 1 is the Federal Government's main effort to improve basic academic skills of poor children. About 5.5 million children in two-thirds of the nation's public schools are served by the multibillion-dollar program, 70 percent of them in elementary grades. The program also pays for breakfast and lunch for these children. 
 Rabbi Leib Glanz, the academy's executive director, said through a spokesman yesterday that agents arrived at the school's sites and asked for various files, including those dealing with Chapter 1 funds. 
 ""The administration of the school is cooperating fully,"" he said through the spokesman. 
 Officials from the El Puente Academy, a small public high school located in Williamsburg, became temporarily ensnarled in the raid when they tried to pick up paychecks, which they eventually got, said Luis Garden Acosta, the executive director of the El Puente community organization. 
 ""We assured them that we had nothing to do with District 14, and we got our checks after we signed a thousand pieces of paper and they photocopied everything,"" Mr. Garden Acosta said."
"187","Downshifting In a 12-Cylinder, 421-Horsepower 512 TR",697063,"|magazine",3,7,1994,"19940703T000000",NA," 
 The oversize Pirelli P Zero tires shudder a warning before breaking loose from the wet pavement. But my reaction is a few tenths of a second slow. The $130,000 sports car spins out of control with a screech despite my desperate efforts to countersteer to the right. 
 ""No problem -- much better than last time,"" soothes my passenger and instructor, Gianni, a master of euphemism and good cheer. Habits formed from decades of driving cars as spongy as department-store Santas, we agree, cannot be changed overnight. Besides, neither we nor the 320-horsepower Ferrari 348 TB was in any real danger. 
 This lesson in physics and humility takes place on a sprinkler-soaked patch of asphalt the size of a football field, part of the Ferrari Mugello racing complex in the hills north of Florence. I am a student at what is arguably the most thrilling (and surely the best-catered) driving school for novices in the world: the two-day Pilota Ferrari, run a dozen times a year for clients and friends of the auto maker. 
 Not many years ago, Ferrari would have shown no more interest in teaching me to accelerate out of a hairpin turn than Isaac Stern would have in brushing up my rendition of ""Three Blind Mice"" on a Stradivarius. Enzo Ferrari, the imperious founder, cultivated an image of exclusivity with the skill of a maitre d'hotel assigning tables at This Year's Restaurant. Buying a Ferrari was a privilege granted with mock reluctance to Europe's leisure class, along with the filthy rich from Beverly Hills, Tokyo and Medellin. And while the street-tame models with their austerely finished interiors often proved as cantankerous as Enzo Ferrari himself -- he saved quality control for the true racing cars -- owning a Ferrari really did pay. Exotic models purchased in the 1980's often doubled in value within a year. And truly rare Ferraris, like the Testarossas of the early 1960's, occasionally trade at auction for as much as $5 million. 
 But recession and changing tastes have rendered the old marketing formula obsolete. The giant Fiat conglomerate, which took over the Ferrari enterprise after Enzo's death in 1988, must now cope with a shrinking demand for symbols of material excess. Hence Ferrari's new customer-friendly face in general and the $4,000 driving school at Mugello in particular. The idea is to get just plain folks who own Ferraris or who could be convinced to buy one to find out how much fun they are to drive. 
 The first day begins with a lecture on oversteer and whatnot. But our class of 23 men (mostly middle-aged professionals) and one woman (a French executive with Jaguar) is distracted, lusting for a taste of the Ferraris that await us. Andrea De Adamich, the former Formula One driver who runs the school, is not there to disappoint. Five lithe 348's and five broader-shouldered 512 TR's idle in rows, each sporting Ferrari's mirrorlike red paint job. Two Alfa Romeo SZ's -- squat, thuggish vehicles -- are the pace cars. 
 Young women in Ferrari jackets, looking like models in an Armani ad, assign the first group for an orientation spin. The rest of us take consolation in thimble-size cups of espresso. (Nowhere at Mugello are we more than 10 steps from a cup. Even the vans that haul the race cars from the factory have cappuccino makers on board.) 
 Then it is my turn, and I draw a 12-cylinder, 421-horsepower 512 TR, successor to the Testarossa as the movie mogul's envymobile of choice. The leather seat is stiff yet surprisingly comfortable. The controls are spartan. Only the signature chrome shift lever poking out of a maze of steel gates betrays the fact that I am ensconced in the ultimate boy's toy. Enrico, yet another cheerful instructor, checks my driving position, and off I go. 
 Mugello is a 3.2-mile track with 16 turns, most of them poorly banked; your father's Oldsmobile would have trouble averaging 40 miles an hour. Professionals in racing cars manage easily at 110 miles per hour, topping out at about 200 m.p.h. on the straightaway in front of the bleachers. 
 We dawdle through a few laps, with Gianni explaining by radio into my earphones how to minimize the lateral thrust in each turn by ""following the line"" -- aiming at cones set at strategic spots along the edges of the track. Racing cars, it soon becomes apparent, requires both quick reflexes and an intuitive connection to the vehicle. 
 After a few off-track sessions to learn the basics of recovering from a spin, the pace is increased to white-knuckle velocity. ""Easy, easy,"" counsels Enrico over the radio. ""Sacrifice the first turn of the S, accelerate smoothly, smoothly out of the second."" 
 I comply too cautiously, letting the Alfa ahead of me gain a few car lengths. ""More throttle, more throttle,"" shouts Enrico. ""You're driving a Ferrari!"" 
 Indeed I am. And when the circuit is finally etched into my brain, I relax sufficiently to test my newly won skills on these glorious machines. We drive for hours, alternating between the 348's and the 512's. 
 The 512 is a muscular beast whose throaty rumble at idle is transformed to a roar by the time I shift from third to fourth at about 90 miles an hour. Given a mile of straight smooth pavement (I wasn't), it can reach 190 m.p.h. The 348 is a tabby by comparison, lacking the explosive acceleration of the 512. But its better balance, musical V-8 and predictability in the tight curves made it my favorite. 
 The sweet perfection of it all (not to mention the bottomless glasses of Chianti and grappa at dinner) makes comrades of the disparate student body -- the Mercedes-Benz dealer from Mexico City, the cardiologist from New York, the banker from Geneva, the nephew of the King of Spain. They talk solemnly of driving and collecting Ferraris as a rite in the religion of hedonism. 
 If worship at the altar of Ferrari is beyond your means, there are some low-church alternatives that are far from humble. The BMW/Skip Barber Driving School (203-824-0771) offers one- and two-day courses at some of the prettiest race tracks in America, using nifty little 3-series BMW's. The Bob Bondurant School of High Performance Driving (800-842-7223) near Phoenix does a boffo four-day course that starts in Mustang GT's and ends up in Formula Ford race cars. 
 Whatever the setting, going very fast in a very good car without Smokey on your tail is a kick. And it might even make you a better driver: De Adamich gravely (and sincerely) notes that the skills required to drive a Ferrari near its limits are much the same as those needed to keep a Buick from plowing into a tree on an ice-slicked highway. 
 From the company's perspective, of course, safety is a lagniappe. The point of Pilota Ferrari is to transform the superaffluent into addicts craving yet another six-figure fix. For me, the real high was the sense of guiltless pleasure, of ever so briefly becoming part of a world where the sun always shines, the fibers are always natural and the toughest choice is between second gear and third.

"189","Case of Bangladesh Writer Opens Old Wounds",702522,"|opinion",28,7,1994,"19940728T000000",NA," 
 To the Editor: 
 ""Bangladesh Court Will Rule on Writer"" (letter, July 16) by Humayun Kabir, Ambassador of Bangladesh, ignores the concerns many Bangladeshis have about the controversy involving the writer Taslima Nasrin. 
 The essence of the problem is this: A writer is in hiding today in Bangladesh because certain people do not like what she says. No amount of shuffling and rearranging of legal points can alter this fact. 
 This is the first occurrence of such censorship of a writer in Bangladesh: censorship by independent political groups that the state has been unwilling or unable to control. The implications are serious, not just on account of the danger to Ms. Nasrin's life, grave as that is, but perhaps more critically, the dangerous precedent that is being set about discussion of ideas in Bangladeshi society. 
 The Ambassador tells us that Ms. Nasrin has the freedom to express her views on religion. It is difficult to determine the nature of this freedom, since Ms. Nasrin's ""utterances"" led to her being charged with section 295(a) of the Bangladesh Penal Code, as the Ambassador mentions. 
 Note that those who issued death threats against Ms. Nasrin and who organize demonstrations calling for her death have been given a ""stern warning"" by the Government; Ms. Nasrin, however, is issued a warrant of arrest on the basis of vestiges of British colonial law from 100 years ago. The partiality here is too crude to inspire any desire for debate. 
 In any case, debate focused on Ms. Nasrin can be misleading. It ignores what is beneath today's crisis in Bangladesh: the unequal status of women in that society and the rising tide of fundamentalism, perhaps as part of a wider phenomenon in the world. 
 In Bangladesh this has encouraged a reaction by religious forces against the empowerment of women by grass-roots organizations, and a return to political prominence of people who were until recently discredited for their association with the genocide conducted in the name of religion by the Pakistan Army in 1971 in what was then East Pakistan. 
 To this list one must add, sadly, the alienation of Hindu Bangladeshis from their country after Islam was made the state religion, an alienation the Ambassador does not seem aware of when he lauds the secular nature of the laws of Bangladesh. These are the issues Ms. Nasrin talked about. These are the issues the Ambassador chose not to talk about. 
 Is it possible, then, that Ms. Nasrin has touched on some of the problems of Bangladeshi society, raw problems that must be dealt with, not hidden under the shameful cover of British colonial laws? Is it possible to imagine that, instead of being the criminal she is made out to be, Ms. Nasrin represents, however imperfectly, the hopes and aspirations with which people welcomed the end of a horrible genocide and the birth of a new nation in South Asia a quarter-century ago? 
 Is it possible that they who ask for the death of a mere powerless writer represent the antithesis of the hope and courage that gave Bangladesh victory one wintry day in 1971? If so, then behind all the drivel of ""deep anguish"" for hurt religious feelings, the Nasrin issue is part of a grab for power by the same fundamentalists who sided with the perpetrators of genocide in 1971.

"190","Blacks Gain in Sports Jobs",706963,"|sports",18,8,1994,"19940818T000000",NA," 
 The hiring of black athletic administrators by the nation's colleges has grown but still has far to go to achieve racial parity. 
 Those are among the findings of a four-year study by a committee of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. According to the study, which excluded the nation's historically black colleges, 10.1 percent of the 5,889 new administrative positions created since June 1991 were filled by blacks, giving blacks 8.7 percent of the more than 29,000 positions in the 1993-94 academic year. 
 Blacks have moved especially fast into the top positions, accounting for 12.3 percent, or 15 of the 122 the new athletic directors, and increasing their overall representation by almost two thirds, from 2.2 percent (17 of 775 positions) in 1991 to 3.6 percent (32 of 897) this year. 
 Black gains at the top may have come at the expense of those in the second and third tiers. Perhaps because of rapid promotions, the percentage of black associate and athletic directors actually fell during the last year, to 4.5 and 4.9 percent. 
 In one area, blacks seem to have achieved racial parity. According to the committee, 12.9 percent of the head coaches of revenue sports are now black. The 1990 census put the nation's black population at 12.1 percent."
"191","550 Agents' Jobs to Be Cut At Airline",713737,"|business",23,9,1994,"19940923T000000",NA," 
 American Airlines said yesterday that it would contract out the work of 550 agents at 30 airports, a move that American said will save it $35 million next year. 
 Big airlines have been trying to cut costs for years, but American's move is noteworthy because it addresses an area that airlines have been generally reluctant to touch: employees who deal directly with customers. After all, airlines have long cultivated identities based on the service their employees provide. 
 Airlines have hired other carriers in the past to handle their passengers in airports where they offer only a flight or two a day -- as Singapore Airlines and Swissair do for Delta -- but American's decision to contract out customer service jobs in so many cities suggests a broader shift away from tradition. 
 ""Some of the work arrangements that have developed over the past 50 years must change,"" said Robert W. Baker, American's executive vice president of operations. 
 Some analysts said other carriers would most likely make similarly sweeping changes in customer service operations in the future. 
 ""Airlines, like many other industries, are seeking to cut costs and this is just the opening gun of very extensive cost-cutting programs for the industry,"" said Julius Maldutis, an airline stock analyst at Salomon Brothers. ""They will outsource anything they can."" 
 In a similar move, Continental Airlines said last month that America West would start handling its passengers in Phoenix and in Las Vegas, Nev., while Continental would do the same for America West passengers in Houston and Newark. Delta Air Lines, in the midst of a drive to cut $2 billion in annual operating costs a year by 1997, said that nothing would be immune from cuts except for safety and passenger service. 
 American said that the 550 employees who would be affected by the cuts did not spend all their time dealing with customers. The agents, who are not unionized, do many jobs that do not involve customer relations. Their duties include issuing tickets, boarding passengers and handling luggage. 
 The company also said that some jobs at American's hub airports -- like baggage check-in, baggage service and cargo -- would also be gradually contracted out. 
 American said the 550 workers, whose jobs will be contracted out by June 1, will be offered jobs in other cities or severance packages. The airline said when the cuts were fully effective in several years the change would save the company $130 million a year. 
 The airline's stock rose $1.625 yesterday, to $54.625, on the New York Stock Exchange. American has not selected the companies that will do the contract work. However, it said that in some cases other service divisions of American's parent company, the AMR Corporation, would be considered for the work.  COMPANY NEWS"
"192","Marvelous in the Meadowlands: Jets Wind Up Turning Challenge Into Triumph",718741,"|sports",17,10,1994,"19941017T000000",NA," 
 The Jets have lived with insults for so long, surely another barrage couldn't faze them. 
 But today, the New England Patriots taunted them so much -- daring the Jets' defenders again and again to stop them on fourth down -- that it turned into a cause. And the Jets are a club that seems to need a cause. 
 So in a screaming, shouting and shoving match against a division rival, the Jets halted the Pats when it mattered, then ran over them on offense and produced a 24-17 victory. 
 For just a few moments after the game, the Jets even thought they were tied for first place in the A.F.C. East when someone erroneously told them the Dolphins had lost. First place? The Jets haven't been there this late since 1986. 
 But even with Miami's overtime victory against the Raiders, the Jets are tied for second in the division with the Bills at 4-3. It isn't a bad place to be with a bye week coming up, and two straight victories to reflect on, and time to get an injured quarterback healed. 
 In the National Football League, when a team goes for it on fourth down, and it still is early in the game, it is something of an insult to the enemy defense. 
 ""It's telling us: 'We don't think you can stop us,' "" said linebacker Bobby Houston. ""We were talking about it among ourselves. Then right before the plays, we were shouting at them."" 
 The Patriots, under the direction of Coach Bill Parcells, went for it eight times on fourth down. The teams had a 4-4 standoff, including an offside by Ronnie Lott that led to a first down and officially doesn't count as a Patriots fourth-down attempt. 
 But the seven official attempts equal the most ever tried in one game since the Elias Sports Bureau began keeping track of the the statistic 20 years ago. Who had the seven? The Jets, who converted three of the attempts in a game against San Francisco two years ago. 
 Lott knew those in-your-face calls would be coming, though. 
 ""We expected them,"" he said. ""It's Bill Parcells. It's his style."" It's a style Parcells employs because he has a young gem of a quarterback, Drew Bledsoe. But the Jets' defense had plans for him today. Under the orchestration of defensive coordinator Greg Robinson, they blitzed the young man with the golden arm. And blitzed and blitzed, sacking him three times in all. 
 ""We just had to come up with ways to keep him from getting the ball,"" explained Robinson. And while Bledsoe threw it 41 times, he barely completed half his passes, and usually not for big yardage. 
 Meanwhile, Johnny Johnson produced the kind of game that negates fourth-down attempts. The versatile Jets runner finally sprung loose on important first-down runs after what has been an erratic season. Seven times he dashed for 7 or more yards on first-and-10. Four times he amassed 12 or more yards. That made life so much simpler for Boomer Esiason, who still has a sprained left ankle. 
 Over all, Johnson finished with 122 yards on 21 carries. On first down, he was even more impressive: 93 yards on 13 attempts. 
 But Johnson is a low-key athlete, and he declined to talk to the news media afterward. 
 ""I don't want to look like a front-runner,"" he said to a member of the front office. In a happy clubhouse, he remained in the trainer's room with a towel around his waist, sipping a cup of coffee. 
 Johnson hadn't been slated to be a one-man show today. The Jets had hoped that Adrian Murrell, their potentially dangerous big-play runner, would carry a dozen times or more and spark the running game. Instead, Murrell was injured in the first quarter and is expected to be out from four to six weeks with a sprained right knee. 
 Still, Johnson's strong day might be a signal that the Jets have altered their San Francisco-style attack and gone back to their cold-weather roots. Call it East Coast meat and potatoes instead of West Coast quiche. 
 Certainly, the Pats don't seem to be in that grind-it-out mold, although they did get a big game out of former Jet Blair Thomas. 
 Going into today's game, he had carried twice all season while being hobbled with a bad ankle. 
 The former first-round pick, whose ineffective four-year career here symbolized the struggles of the Jets' Bruce Coslet-Dick Steinberg regime, made a surprising return to Giants Stadium. Shaking off boos, he produced a touchdown, and over all, rushed for 63 yards on 14 carries. 
 But as good as Thomas was, it was the Jets' rushing attack that was dominant today, with Brad Baxter picking up 38 yards in 12 attempts to go along with Johnson's effort. Finally, the Jets seem to have their runners in rhythm, with their offensive line playing up to its ability. 
 ""This was a transition in our style a little bit,"" Coach Pete Carroll conceded. ""We feel good running the football."" 
 They must have from the first play of the game, when Johnson roared up the middle for 16 yards. At the same time, it was the defense and special teams that ultimately put the ball in position for the Jets to win. Three of the Jets' scores followed turnovers, including a fumble recovery by Lott, who had a spectacular timing sack of Bledsoe on fourth down late in the third quarter. 
 And Hasty, who has felt abused by the news media since he was burned for a touchdown by Denver's John Elway in Game 2, let his emotion out by running 30 yards to the edge of the stands after he sacked Bledsoe on a key fourth-down play in the fourth quarter. 
 The Jets had been thinking about Bledsoe all week. Their assignment: get to the guy who averages 47 passes a game. Bledsoe helped the Jets on his very first snap, which he fumbled, turning the ball over to Lott on the Jets' 11. Three plays letter, Baxter scored from the 1. 
 New England produced its own touchdown after Esiason was sacked (one of six times he went down) and fumbled. That led to a Bledsoe-to-Ray Crittenden scoring pass, on fourth down from the Jets' 3. Before the half, the Jets went ahead, 21-7, on Baxter's second rushing touchdown -- 2 yards -- and a 4-yard pass from Esiason to Johnny Mitchell. 
 But on a Thomas-dominated drive that ended with his touchdown from 4 yards out, the Pats cut the edge to 21-14 in the fourth quarter only to see Nick Lowery connect from 37 yards for the Jets after Hasty's fourth-down sack of Bledsoe. Matt Bahr's late 40-yard field goal again put the Patriots 7 points away, but the Jets recovered his onside kick in the closing seconds. 
 Thus, the Jets finished half their home season with a 3-1 record, heard the cheers of more than 71,000 fans and maybe even can remember that on Saturday night, at a dinner honoring the club's most valuable players of the past, they were given enough inspiration to last a season. 
 For now, the Jets can concentrate on the present, even the future. For many, it's about time. EXTRA POINTS

 The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell about 6/32 to 95 7/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.92 percent from 7.91 percent on Friday. 
 A report that showed a 1.3 percent surge in the sales of new homes in October weighed down Government securities. The Commerce Department report suggested that six increases in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve have not pushed mortgage rates high enough to slow the housing industry. 
 Prices of short-term Treasury bills fell sharply yesterday in anticipation of an interest rate increase. Bill rates were up an average 15 basis points in secondary market trading. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 At its regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, the Treasury saw rates jump to their highest levels since early 1991. 
 In the municipal market, analysts continued to weigh the impact of the Orange County investment fund's troubles. Yesterday's trading offered few clues. 
 Robert J. Froehlich, director of research at Van Kampen & Merritt, said the market was waiting for more details to be released after an emergency meeting of the county's board of supervisors . 
 Late yesterday, the resignation of the Orange County treasurer, Robert L. Citron, was announced. 
 Mr. Froehlich noted that so far the two largest participants in the county's investment fund, the transportation and water agencies, have both agreed to stay in the fund. ""If there is a mass defection,"" he said, ""then those paper losses will turn to actual losses."" The county's $7.8 billion investment pool represents contributions from 170 municipal agencies. 
 Of the $7.8 billion, approximately $4.7 billion is from Orange County agencies required to invest their money with the treasurer, including the school districts. The remaining $3.1 billion is from voluntary or ""discretionary"" investors, including the county transportation, toll road and sanitation agencies, as well as cities like Irvine and Huntington Beach. The money borrowed by the school districts is also part of the discretionary portion. 
 James Lynch of the Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory, said: ""Right now potential sellers of these bonds will hesitate to sell because they don't know how it will all unfold and are afraid they will sell too cheap. Buyers hesitated because they want to be sure they are buying at the lowest price."" 
 Peter B. Coffin, head of an investment advisory firm with the same name in Boston, said there was not a lot of activity for Orange County bonds, but he said the situation could give many retail traders an excuse to sell other issues. 
 Elsewhere, traders said South Africa was expected to sell its first post-apartheid bond issue in international markets early this week. 
 The Government plans to sell $500 million in five-year global notes through a group led by two investment banks, Goldman, Sachs & Company and the Swiss Bank Corporation.

"197","New Guidelines to Aid in Treatment of Manic-Depressive Illness",729922,"|health|u.s.",8,12,1994,"19941208T000000",NA," 
 New guidelines for the best treatment of manic-depressive illness were issued today, emphasizing that the illness can be successfully treated with the right combination of drugs and psychotherapy, but that it is often misdiagnosed and mistreated. 
 Susan Dime-Meehan, executive director of the National Depressive and Manic Depressive Association, based in Chicago, said at a news conference held today by the American Psychiatric Association that the new guidelines ""will lead to earlier diagnosis and better treatment."" 
 The guidelines, she added, ""are the minimum that patients should now expect from their doctors."" 
 The American Psychiatric Association today officially issued the 30-page manual on the best methods of treating people with manic-depression, which doctors now often call bipolar affective disorder. It is characterized by wide mood swings, often alternating between manic elation and severe depression. 
 Two million to three million adults in the United States, or about 1.6 percent of the nation's population, suffer from the disorder. Without treatment, about one-fifth of those with the illness will commit suicide. 
 Dr. Robert Hirschfeld, chairman of the group that compiled the report for the psychiatric association, said that the disorder was often mistaken for alcoholism, wildness or other forms of acting out. Even when it is diagnosed, the best forms of treatment are often not used. 
 ""The biggest change in recent years in the treatment of this disorder is that there are new drugs which appear to be very helpful, and there are also now psychotherapies designed specifically to treat bipolar disorder."" 
 Lithium, a drug whose use for manic-depression was discovered four decades ago, remains the best basic treatment for most people, the guidelines say. But they also said that for about one-third or more patients, the drugs valproate and carbamazepine are useful as mood-stabilizers. 
 Another type of drug, the benzodiazepine class of tranquilizers, are also used to help calm patients while lithium and the other two drugs take effect over several weeks. 
 The guidelines now suggest that the various drugs used to stabilize a patient's mood should be tried before another group of drugs that has been commonly used. They are the anti-psychotic drugs like Haldol, and others in the class of neuroleptics. 
 The manic-depressive illness is one in which patients cycle between depression and mania, with the mania being the symptom that sets it apart from regular ""unipolar"" depression. 
 The manic phase is marked by a sharp change in personality, often including a sudden lack of a need for sleep. It is also marked by extravagant behavior. 
 Ms. Dime-Meehan, a former corporate executive who herself suffers from mania, noted that she once spent $27,000 in one week on clothes, and flew from Chicago to Los Angeles for lunch 32 times in less than a year. 
 Ms. Dime-Meehan said that in a survey her group had done, people with the disorder took an average of eight years of seeking help, from at least three doctors, before getting the right diagnosis. ""These guidelines now tell you what to expect from your doctor,"" she added. 
 The new guidelines, called ""Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Patients with Bipolar Disorder,"" are published as a supplement to the American Journal of Psychiatry, Vol. 151, No. 12, December 1994, and are available from the American Psychiatric Association, 1400 K St., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20007"
"198","As U.N. Mission Winds Down, Peace Remains Elusive",731628,"|world",17,12,1994,"19941217T000000","|ETHIOPIA"," 
 As the billion-dollar United Nations famine-relief and peacekeeping operation in Somalia packs up and prepares to leave, no settlement is in sight for the factional violence that prompted the mission in the first place. 
 Fighting between clans has actually increased in recent weeks in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, heightening concern that the final phase of the pullout will not be peaceful. Clan officials say a peace conference is continuing, but aid workers say it never seems to convene. 
 Each day, meanwhile, containers filled with everything from furniture to computers and cars are being trucked down to Mogadishu's port, and at least two ships have already sailed. The last United Nations troops will be out of Somalia no later than March 31, bringing an end to an effort that at its peak in early 1993 included 25,000 American soldiers and 13,000 troops from other nations deployed as peacekeepers. 
 When the United Nations pulls out, it will be terminating the jobs of 5,000 to 6,000 Somalis working as guards, construction workers, mechanics, cooks and office workers and another 9,000 Somalis armed and paid as police agents. 
 Many of those workers are providing for families of up to 10 people. Relief officials say the withdrawal could leave as many as 100,000 people in Mogadishu without a source of income, and further destabilize a city riven by clan rivalry. 
 Many Somalis are also not happy about troops taking equipment with them, and the move has set off a scramble for spoils from the two-year peacekeeping mission. General Mohammed Farah Aidid, one of two main clan leaders in Mogadishu, for example, declared in a recent broadcast on his local radio station that the United Nations equipment was a ""national asset."" 
 Stealing, armed threats and extortion have become routine in the capital. ""This pillaging is creating a very tense atmosphere,"" said Jean-Fabrice Pietri, who leads International Action Against Hunger, a French relief agency, in Somalia. ""The Somalis know it's first come, first served."" 
 Relief officials say the United Nations and the United States could try to pay off both General Aidid and his rival, Mohammed Ali Mahdi, to prevent holdups and massive stealing. But both warlords only loosely control their militias. 
 Last week, Somali militiamen attacked Bangladeshi troops when they tried to leave their base north of Mogadishu, setting off a battle with Pakistani tanks and helicopter gunships that intervened to rescue them. Relief officials and United Nations military officers said the clash arose from a rent dispute between the United Nations and elders of the Murassade clan, who were not satisfied with a prearranged settlement. 
 Later in the week United Nations workers were held hostage for more than four hours in their compound by armed Somali security guards who were not satisfied with a proposed severance package. 
 In the scramble for spoils, perhaps the most coveted prize -- one that Somali clans are already positioning themselves for -- is the United Nations headquarters, which occupies 80 acres of what was once the largest American embassy compound in Africa south of the Sahara. 
 The United Nations staff will be moved temporarily in January to the city's main airport, where they will be guarded by Pakistani troops. 
 The American Embassy compound was looted after civil war broke out in 1991, with Somalis stripping everything from plumbing to wiring. The United Nations rebuilt it from scratch, investing more than $100 million to turn it into a self-contained city with electricity, a sewage system and speed bumps. 
 Diplomats and relief officials also predict a big struggle for Mogadishu's port and airport, lucrative links to the outside world. Many Somalis predict that the airport will be taken over by General Aidid's clan, but the fate of the port is uncertain. 
 Relief agencies are relying on their own hard-won relationships with the various Somali clans to guarantee their security after the peacekeeping force leaves. Mr. Pietri of International Action said the agencies were trying to find ways of remaining in Somalia so as not to break the fragile support system now in place, but he is adopting a wait-and-see attitude. 
 The French agency has been working in Somalia since early 1992 running nutritional clinics for pregnant mothers and children and working on sanitation projects. When Mr. Pietri or any of his seven Western staff members leave one of their two compounds, they travel in convoys of two or three cars with two armed guards in each vehicle. 
 ""The security situation has little chance of getting better in the next months,"" he said. ""We are always on our guard. The most minor of rumors, and we immediately call together the Somali staff to defuse any tension."""
"199","Florida's Plea for Immigration Relief Fails",732541,"|u.s.",21,12,1994,"19941221T000000","|FLORIDA"," 
 In a troubling signal for states seeking relief from the costs associated with illegal immigration, a Federal District Court judge today threw out a lawsuit in which Florida officials sought to recover nearly $1 billion a year from the Federal Government to pay for services to illegal immigrants. 
 In his decision, Judge Edward B. Davis said he recognized the tremendous financial burden to Florida ""due to the methods in which the Federal Government has chosen to enforce the immigration laws."" But he said that did not create a legal theory under which the state could recover money. 
 The judge agreed with the Federal Government's argument that the case presented ""a political question,"" not a legal one, over ""the proper allocation of Federal resources and the execution of discretionary policies"" dealing with national defense, immigration and foreign affairs. 
 The decision was a bad omen for at least six other states that have also sued to shift costs to Washington for some immigration-related expenses, saying they are bearing a disproportionately high influx of illegal immigrants. 
 Seeking restitution in court is seen by some of those states as a preferable alternative to measures like denying benefits to the aliens, as voters in California chose to do last month with Proposition 187. 
 Governor Lawton Chiles of Florida called the court's decision today ""only a temporary setback"" and said the state planned to appeal. 
 ""I am committed to making sure that Floridians will not pay for the Federal Government's failure to enforce its own immigration laws,"" he said in a statement. 
 The ruling comes as more than 20,000 Cuban refugees await word about their fate in American detention camps in Panama and at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. 
 Most of those refugees were bound for Florida when the Clinton Administration, in a reversal of a longtime policy, decided in August to deny entry to Cubans fleeing Fidel Castro. 
 More than 5,000 Haitian refugees are also detained in Guantanamo and want to enter the United States. 
 In their lawsuit, Florida officials argued that the Federal Government had failed to fulfill its obligations to guard against illegal immigration and to deport such immigrants. 
 In a report released last March, state officials estimated that illegal immigration cost Florida $884 million a year, primarily for education, social services and law enforcement. 
 About 345,000 illegal immigrants live in the state, Florida officials said. 
 Governor Chiles opposes cutting off services as Proposition 187 would do, and Judge Davis said in his decision that he agreed with Florida's argument that it faced ""a Hobson's choice,"" or one that offers no choice. 
 ""If Florida chooses to not provide services to illegal aliens including closing schools, emergency rooms, etc., the impact on the health, safety and welfare of its citizenry could be potentially devastating,"" the judge said in his written decision. ""If on the other hand Florida chooses to provide the services, the cost could cripple the state."" 
 There are efforts by some groups in Florida to push for measures similar to Proposition 187 in California, which requires teachers and clinic doctors to deny help to illegal immigrants and to report them to the police. The measure, which Californians approved 3 to 2, is under court review. 
 In Texas, one of the six other states that have filed suit to gain compensation for some immigration-related costs, a Federal judge has said he was inclined to dismiss the suit and indicated relief should come from Congress instead. 
 But Texas officials said they were optimistic that their arguments would prevail on appeal. 
 ""We believe strongly that the Constitution compels the Federal Government to reimburse the state,"" said Ward Tisdale, a spokesman for the Texas Attorney General's office. ""We feel a judicial remedy is far preferable and more responsible than the extreme measures we've seen in other parts of the country."" 
 Florida officials said humanitarian Federal policies that had forced the state to absorb successive waves of political refugees from Cuba and other countries had also greatly strained resources in areas like education and health care. Governor Chiles argues that if those now held in detention camps are allowed into the United States they should have financial sponsorships and should relocate in other states. 
 But Steve Forester, the supervising lawyer for the Haitian Refugee Center, contended that politics rather than cost ultimately determines which immigrants are acceptable. He cited the different treatment afforded to Cuban and Haitian children held in the detention camps -- unaccompanied Cuban minors have been allowed into the country but their Haitian counterparts have not -- and attributed it to the political clout of the Cuban-American community in Miami. 
 ""It has to do with domestic politics and the fact that the scapegoating of immigrants translates into votes,"" Mr. Forester said. 
 On Monday, a Federal appeals court judge reversed a lower court ruling that would have allowed the roughly 230 Haitian children who have been in the camps since July to enter the country. Lawyers for the Government have argued that the Haitians, unlike the Cubans, can now return to a democratic homeland. 
 Mr. Forester and others at the Haitian Refugee Center today called on Americans to appeal to Attorney General Janet Reno to parole the Haitian children into the United States."
"200","'94 Grammy Nominations: Not Just the Familiar",735287,"|arts",6,1,1995,"19950106T000000",NA," 
 The 37th annual Grammy Awards will be a battle between the old and the new. Some 435 nominees for the annual music awards, which will be given out in a ceremony on March 1 in Los Angeles, were announced yesterday by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in a news conference at the Hard Rock Cafe in Manhattan, and they include more young artists in top categories than in recent years. 
 In the competition for record of the year, an award given to a single, a new artist, Sheryl Crow (""All I Wanna Do""), is going up against old hands like Bruce Springsteen (""Streets of Philadelphia"") and Bonnie Raitt (""Love Sneakin' Up on You""). For album of the year, the young gun Seal (""Seal"") challenges Tony Bennett (""MTV Unplugged""), Eric Clapton (""From the Cradle"") and the operatic juggernaut of Placido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jose Carreras (""The Three Tenors in Concert '94""). More dramatically, in the best spoken word or nonmusical album category, the punk-rock poet Henry Rollins must compete with the Bible (as read by Gregory Peck). 
 Sweeping up nominations this year were Elton John, Babyface, Ms. Crow, Ms. Raitt and Mr. Springsteen, who received five nominations each. Among these artists, only Ms. Crow, a singer who released her debut album last year, has never been nominated for a Grammy. All the rest have been nominated at least 12 times and received no less than 2 Grammys each. 
 Also prevalent among the list of nominees is the soundtrack to ""The Lion King,"" which received eight nominations. 
 Last year, the recording academy was criticized for combining the best male and female rock vocal performance awards and then not nominating any women for the new sex-neutral category. The recording academy claimed that no eligible female entries could be found. This year, the award has been separated into female and male divisions again, and the recording academy has found five eligible female rock singers: Liz Phair, Melissa Etheridge, Sam Phillips, Ms. Raitt and Ms. Crow. 
 Another new category, best rock album, will also be particularly interesting to watch because it includes releases by a top group and a well-established performer who have never received competitive Grammys: the Rolling Stones (""Voodoo Lounge"") and Neil Young (""Sleeps With Angels""). Other categories added this year include best pop vocal collaboration, best country album and best Latin jazz performance. 
 In classical music, the nominees for best album all feature works by 20th-century composers: Samuel Barber, Bela Bartok, Claude Debussy and Gustav Mahler. 
 The winners in each category will be announced at the Grammy show, to be held at the Shrine Auditorium, and televised by CBS, with Paul Reiser as the master of ceremonies. They will be selected by 7,000 singers, musicians, record-business professionals and other members of the recording academy. Recordings released between Oct. 1, 1993, and Sept. 30, 1994, were eligible.

"201","ON TOUR WITH: Awadagin Pratt; Knowing What It Means to Solo",743608,"|home|garden|style",16,2,1995,"19950216T000000",NA," 
 ""YOU got any tools?"" Awadagin Pratt asks in the darkness backstage. Out front, the high-school students in the audience are either fidgeting at the prospect of an hour of classical music or contemplating a midmorning nap. Mr. Pratt, who has been sipping coffee from a very tall plastic cup, is not much more awake himself. 
 The piano lid is up. The spotlights are on. But a screw has come loose in Mr. Pratt's custom-made blond-wood bench, the one he carries from concert to concert, the one that puts him only 13 1/2 inches off the floor, the one that lets him go eyeball to ivory like a latter-day Glenn Gould. 
 The high-school administrator and the concert promoter who arranged this appearance at High Point High School in Beltsville, Md., cannot find a screwdriver. Mr. Pratt fishes a Swiss Army knife out of a pocket and manages to tighten the wobbly leg enough to last through the hour. Then he lopes onstage, bench in one hand, coffee cup in the other. 
 Mr. Pratt will lope across quite a different stage next Thursday at Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center, without the coffee but also without the white tie and tails that most soloists wear for their debuts with the New York Philharmonic. 
 Mr. Pratt, who is 28 and pronounces his first name ah-wah-DODGE-in, is not your garden-variety, prize-winning young pianist. Besides his low-slung piano bench and his casual-looking clothes, there are his dreadlocks. And there is the thing that makes him a rarity in the mostly white world of classical music: he is black. He sounds as if he is tired of talking about it, as if he has heard the same questions over and over. 
 ""I sort of expect that, in time, all the excess stuff won't be news: the bench, the dreadlocks, the blackness,"" he says. ""Not new news. When I wear T-shirts at a performance, that's what makes me comfortable. A tux, that creates barriers. That's the most considered and plotted aspect of my appearance. I thought it was just silly to wear tails."" 
 And the dreadlocks? ""There were people in school who frowned on it, said it was self-destructive,"" he says. ""I just like the hair style."" From that, he says, he learned something: ""One of the things which became a constant in my life is doing what I think I should be doing without too much concern about what people think."" 
 As a hot young pianist with a big sound and a knack for tackling fast, risky passages, Mr. Pratt can talk like an iconoclast -- for the moment, anyway. He was catapulted into the concert-hall spotlight when he won the 1992 Naumburg International Piano Competition, whose name always seems to be preceded by the word ""prestigious"" the way any mention of the House Ways and Means Committee always seems to follow the word ""powerful."" The award was followed by a recording contract with E.M.I. 
 His second album, a Beethoven sonata recital, is to be released in June. His first, ""A Long Way From Normal,"" came out last year. The title is a play on the name of his hometown, Bloomington-Normal, Ill., where his father taught physics and his mother taught social work at Illinois State University. His sister, Menah, grew up to be a lawyer. 
 He is 5 feet 10 1/2, though he seems taller. He is in good shape but offstage he walks stealthily, as if he does not want to draw attention to himself. But at 4 or 5 he was running around waving his arms like a conductor. Before long he was not only taking piano lessons, but playing the violin. ""It's harder,"" he says. ""But the piano has more repertoire."" 
 He enrolled at the University of Illinois, then transferred to the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore. He says the New England Conservatory of Music accepted him in violin but not piano, and the Cleveland Institute of Music in piano but not violin. Only at Peabody could he study both. 
 Once there, Mr. Pratt went one better: he added conducting to his course list and became the first person in Peabody's 137-year history to graduate with three areas of concentration. And with his low-slung piano bench, which began life as a lamp table in a furnished apartment he rented while at Peabody. 
 ""I like to sit low,"" he says. ""I've sat low since about 1984, because of my interest in Glenn Gould. A lot of times, the stage manager will be staring at the bench. He'll say: 'Why do you want a table on the stage? You're sitting on that?' "" 
 At the Philharmonic, where he is to be the soloist in Grieg's Piano Concerto in A minor (Op. 16), he will be even lower than he used to be. His 13 1/2-inch bench is half an inch lower than its predecessor in Mr. Pratt's knapsack, the lamp table. 
 Giving up the lamp table was not easy. After gluing its legs back together, Mr. Pratt lugged it out on stage one last time, for a concert in Columbus, Ohio, ""to say goodbye so it wouldn't feel jilted."" He hopes someday to have an adjustable bench of koa wood, which Hawaiians use for canoes and surfboards. 
 Thanks to the Naumburg prize, he now finds himself jetting around a lot, although he says he does not much like flying. But it is not clear from a conversation what he dislikes most: the droning engines, the stale airplane air or the slights he has had to endure. He describes flight attendants who told him he did not belong in first class and a North Carolina hotel clerk who could not seem to find a fax his manager had sent, and tried to have Mr. Pratt thrown out when he complained. 
 Then there was the time he was arrested in front of Peabody. Late for a chamber-music session, he was dashing down the block when an officer stopped him. 
 ""I said, 'You're stopping me because I'm a black guy running down the street.' He's like, 'Why do you got to bring race into this?' He demands my ID. There are two Peabody guards there saying, 'He's a student here,' but he calls for backup."" Mr. Pratt was taken into custody on a disorderly conduct charge, which he says was dropped on condition that he not sue for wrongful arrest. 
 Mr. Pratt brings all of this up only after the ""informance"" at the high school. It turns out that an informance is a kind of one-man ""Young People's Concert"" without the klieg lights, cameras or high-voltage energy of Leonard Bernstein. 
 He does informances to be a role model for black teen-agers, to demystify classical music and to prove that professional sports are not the only path to fame. ""Parents have to see it's possible for one of us, so to speak, to do it, to encourage their kids,"" he says. ""People told me, 'It's just an hour of your time, 70 or 80 percent of a solo recital.' But you can't just kick back. You have to be very engaging with the audience."" 
 Appropriately, considering that he and some of the students are still fighting the sandman, he starts the informance with Bach's chorale prelude ""Sleepers Wake."" Halfway through, the teachers' walkie-talkies crackle: ""We need help. Big fight down here."" The call, apparently, is from some other part of the building: Mr. Pratt's audience increasingly is with him, concentrating. 
 Talking between pieces -- and sips of coffee -- he explains how ""this Liszt man"" transcribed operas or how Robert Schumann ruined his right hand, prompting someone in the audience to shout ""eee-ugh."" And then a question-and-answer session, with some very personal questions: Are you married? Is being a concert pianist glamorous? How much do you make? 
 * No. 
 * One big drawback: ""Practicing on the road is difficult."" 
 * Six figures, but ""I don't make as much as Shaq."""

 To the Editor: 
 Re ""Why the Philippines Exports Its Children"" (letter, April 1): While the Philippine population growth rate ""is one of the highest in the world,"" as George Raymond Tyndall says, it is too sweeping to conclude that that is the main problem in the Philippines. Nor should anyone make too much of the conflict on this question between the Roman Catholic Church and the Government. 
 The main problem in the Philippines is underdevelopment, in which the so-called Filipino elite thrives, and consumerism, a system in which even the lowly spade that our people can make is imported. The main problem is a lack of basic industrialization. 
 When it is considered that there are in a school year some 17 million students, the equivalent of the population of Australia, and that we graduate tens of thousands of professionals every year, for most of whom there are no jobs commensurate to their skills and talent, you begin to understand the exodus of Filipinos abroad -- from doctors and nurses, to engineers and architects, from jewelers to maids. The exodus is caused not by the population growth rate but by an underdeveloped economy. NICASIO G. VALDERRAMA New York, April 1, 1995"

 WE comfort our friends, loved ones, and lawyers at their homes and offices. We answer desperate phone calls at inappropriate hours. We keep America's hardware and software humming. We are America's unpaid computer consultants. And we shudder when we discover that our clients have failed to master basic but unobvious techniques we insist on calling simple. 
 Software and hardware manufacturers pay lip service to ""usability testing,"" but in the real world very intelligent people fail to grasp some of the simplest ways to improve the hardware and software they use every day. The reason is that the hardware and software remain devilishly difficult to use, and the manuals can be exquisitely stupid. 
 For instance, today's computers come with most of their software already installed on the hard disk. The job of transferring that software to floppy disks for safekeeping is increasingly being left to the customer. A program to help do the job is usually supplied; the requisite blank disks and half-hour or so of patience are not. But the noble idea of creating an ""emergency boot disk"" that will let you start the machine if you or your software should accidentally do something awful may not be mentioned at all. 
 Monitors are meant to be adjusted, yet on the evidence of the misaligned displays on many desks, users seem to have a morbid fear of touching the buttons. Yet as delivered, the controls are rarely set properly. A few minutes of fiddling can usually enlarge or shrink the picture to fill the screen, center it vertically and horizontally, straighten out the edges, and optimize brightness and contrast. The manual is usually worth a peek: infrequently used controls are often available only by pressing arbitrary combinations of buttons unexplained on the display. Modern monitors will remember most settings, but be prepared to adjust brightness and contrast as ambient light changes. 
 Some monitor capabilities are activated not by buttons but by software. With Windows machines, finding and understanding that software is not always easy, but typically it will let you adjust three different things. ""Resolution"" is the common but somewhat misleading term for how many dots (pixels to the cognoscenti) appear on the screen. ""Color depth"" refers to how many different colors you can see; 8-bit color gives you 256, 16-bit displays 65,536 hues, and 24-bit translates to more than 16 million. Finally, ""vertical refresh rate,"" measured in hertz (Hz in your manual), tells you how many times per second the electron beam repaints the image. 
 Out of the box, the software is typically set for 640 dots horizontally, 480 vertically, 256 colors and a vertical refresh rate of 60 hertz. The refresh rate should be changed immediately. Higher rates (72 and 76 have become popular) reduce or eliminate flickering, but there are a couple of catches. With some video cards, increasing the refresh rate may impede performance a bit. More important, some monitors may not be able to handle the highest refresh rates the software and video card offers, particularly at higher resolutions. If in doubt, try to read the software and monitor manuals side by side. When that doesn't work, call your personal consultant. 
 Windows applications cannot change resolutions, so you have to do it for them with the help of your software. Many programs, particularly multimedia productions, work best at 640 by 480 pixels and 256 colors. Running them at higher resolutions will simply make them appear in a small window, and higher color depths may slow them down. But with spreadsheets and word processors, higher resolutions let you see more of your document, though the characters will be smaller. Graphics programs virtually demand higher resolutions and color depths. 
 Experiment, but be warned: setting display software incorrectly may temporarily blind your monitor. To recover, reboot your machine and press the F5 key when you see the message ""Starting MS-DOS."" Change to your Windows subdirectory, type ""setup,"" press the enter key, and follow the menus and prompts to change the display setting to ""VGA."" Then reboot your machine and use your display software or the Windows Setup program to regain the full performance of your monitor. 
 A second warning: video driver software can cause problems not just with screen displays, but also with printers and serial ports. Check with the vendor of your computer or video card to make sure you have the latest version of that software. But note that ""improved"" drivers often introduce new problems. 
 This brings us to the importance of ""readme"" files, where most software reveals, among other things, the screen resolution it considers best. ""Readme""files also contain important (though rarely exhaustive) information on potential problems and ways around them. Fathoming ""readme"" files can be difficult, but skipping them can cause needless pain and suffering. 
 Windows users would also do well to master the ins and outs of the control panel. Much of the tweaking it permits is cosmetic, but some can greatly affect the way your system works. For example, the control panel lets you adjust the sensitivity of your pointing device; some mice and trackballs let you fiddle endlessly, creating fancy cursors and tricks. 
 The control panel's mysterious ""386 enhanced"" icon and its ""virtual memory"" button can also enhance Windows performance. Merely creating a ""permanent swap file"" and clicking the ""32-bit file access"" box are virtually guaranteed to speed things up. So are two DOS programs called Memmaker and Smartdrive, which rearrange the way certain DOS programs user memory and control the flow of data to and from the hard drive, respectively. If you master the on-line documentation for these, you are ready to become an unpaid consultant yourself.

 RESTAURANTS CAN open and close with startling speed in Jerusalem, often because their owners prove to have more business moxie than culinary skill. But in a city where eating on the run is a long tradition, some tiny take-out places endure for decades thanks to customer loyalty. 
 Take Shalom Falafel. It is, literally, a hole in the wall downtown on Bezalel Street, by the Urfali Synagogue. Yet for three generations, people have lined up on the street for pita bread stuffed with -- what else? -- falafel, the Middle Eastern snack of mashed chickpeas mixed with spices and herbs. The lines can be even longer outside the closet-sized Falafel Shlomo, on Mussaief Street in the Bucharan Quarter. Shlomo's place makes Shalom's look like the Russian Tea Room. 
 Jerusalemites will argue over who makes the freshest falafel or the juiciest shwarma, lamb roasted on a spit and stuffed into pita. The list of candidates is long. But the advice here is to be careful in your selection. Cleanliness is sometimes a distant second to godliness in the Holy City. And don't be fooled by royal pretensions. There are all sorts of places with names like Falafel King and King of Shwarma -- a nation of would-be monarchs. Just check that His Highness looks as though he has washed his hands. 
 If falafel is old hat, you might try something called Jerusalem grill. Steakiyat Hatzot, or Midnight Steak House, serves it from a storefront window in the middle of Agrippas Street, the bustling core of the main market. Steakiyat offers familiar items like shashlik, or skewered lamb meat. But its specialty is the grill, an assortment of unrecognizable lamb organs tossed into pita. 
 Not everyone has the stomach for it, though. One alternative is another Jerusalem favorite that can be found on many well-trafficked streets -- a baked concoction made of dough, tomato sauce, cheese and sometimes vegetables. The locals call it pizza.  SIDEWALK SNACKS IN SEVEN CITIES Clyde Haberman is chief of the Jerusalem bureau of The Times."

 Donald Trump's long delayed plan for Riverside South, a $2 billion cluster of apartments and park land on the West Side of Manhattan, hit another snag last week when the House of Representives blocked the use of Federal funds to reconstruct part of the West Side Highway. 
 The measure, sponsored by Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, a West Side Democrat who fiercely opposes the project, provoked a barrage of criticism. The funds were to submerge the elevated section of the highway, between 59th Street and 72d Street, making way for a park with unimpeded access to the Hudson. 
 Mr. Trump claimed victory, saying he intended to build in any case. 
 But an assortment of civic organizations, in an unusual coalition with Mr. Trump, complained that the city risks losing a historic opportunity. 
 Despite Mr. Nadler's bill, money could be restored by the Senate or by the House itself. But that would be a tough sell because $72 million has just been spent on the highway. Here are some views on what should come next. Jerrold L. Nadler United States Representative 
 The project is now in serious trouble. Mr. Trump said keeping the highway in place will make the project easier for him to build. That is not true. Relocating the highway is essential so the apartments are marketable. With the highway in its current location, the apartments will look out on highway girders instead of the Hudson River. Riverside South would simply be too massive for the West Side. The infrastructure just can't handle a project of this size. And any park adjacent to this project would be overshadowed and cut off from the West Side by a wall of 45-story buildings, rendering it little more than a small, private front yard for those living in Riverside South. This project is being backed by coalition of arrogant, unrepresentative civic groups that came into the West Side, decided what was best, and imposed it on us. Ruth W. Messinger Manhattan Borough President 
 Would an elevated highway running through the park be fatal? No. I've seen great parks with worse obstacles. The area would remain one of the longest expanses in Manhattan where we can really experience the waterfront. But I continue to believe an at-grade inland highway would make an even better park. Under the restrictions we imposed on this project, the park is to be designed in consultation with the community, emphasizing waterfront access and active recreation. I hope we acheve those goals with a flexible design so that some day, after the just-completed refurbishing of the highway has served its purpose, we might return more of the waterfront to the people and keep less for the road. H. Claude Shostal President, Regional Plan Association 
 The highway relocation is not a dead issue and we will continue to fight for it. I refuse to accept that irresponsible political grandstanding could kill the most important addition of open space in Manhattan since Central Park. Riverside South represents a new way of doing public business, sensible cooperation and compromise instead of conflict and litigation. And the rest of the country is watching to see if it will work. The civic organizations made a deal to withdraw their litigation in exchange for city and state support for the redesigned project. If the new administrations walk away from this agreement, then we will be back to bitter business as usual. Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Senator 
 In February 1977, I stood the remains of a West Side pier and listened to Secretary of Transportation Brock Adams reaffirm a commitment made in the waning hours of the Ford Administration. A Federal interstate highway would be built at river's edge from 43d to the Battery. It would be dug into the bank and a park extending to the river would be built on top. All the way. The equal in our century of Central Park in the last. But then, a Federal judge in a truly baffling decision held that demolishing the piers -- which were already visibly floating out to sea -- would interfere with the spawning grounds of the striped bass. The Federal judge and the Environmental Protection Agency killed Westway. Years have gone by and we now have something of a second chance. In the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, I provided $15 million to sink the elevated West Side highway and build a park over it out to the river's edge. A small sector of what Westway would have been. Possibly an inspiration for more. But, once again, the litigation commences and the future clouds over."

 RL'S DREAM  By Walter Mosley. 267 pp. New York: W. W. Norton & Company. $22. 
 THE ""RL"" of Walter Mosley's new novel, ""RL's Dream,"" is Robert Johnson, the Delta blues singer who died young and violently in 1938. (No one knows why Johnson called himself RL, and Mr. Mosley doesn't attempt an explanation.) Admired by blues connoisseurs in life, he was rediscovered by the largely white, middle-class folk and blues revival of the 1960's, and reborn in a big way 25 years later to a pop audience that acknowledged him as a dark-of-night backwoods conjurer who prefigured everything from Chicago blues to hard rock -- a tormented visionary who bartered his soul to the Devil. And what did he get in return -- genius? women? recognition? It is difficult to speak concretely of Robert Johnson, as it is of many artists who lived lives so short, messy and contrary that if not for their work they would seem like figures in mythology. 
 Although Mr. Mosley brings him to ground in a tangled vignette that arrives about midway in the book, allowing him to breathe hotly on the page, it is ultimately the mythic Robert Johnson who haunts this often startling, emphatic modern-day fable. Mr. Mosley's RL is at once a blues virtuoso who makes dancers go wild, whose ""blues would rip the skin right off yo' back,"" and a gloomy apparition of futility. One disciple who can't shake the dread is Atwater (Soupspoon) Wise, a black Mississippi orphan who briefly traveled with Johnson. Now dying in New York, he is obsessed with recounting and defining their association. Mr. Mosley zooms in on him on the Lower East Side, hobbling in blind terror and befouled agony, with a busted hip and advanced cancer, hallucinating ""a young man with short nappy hair and one dead eye."" When he arrives at his apartment, he is expelled for nonpayment of rent and left to die on the street. 
 Enter Kiki Waters, in pain herself after being stabbed that day by a 10-year-old black boy. One of the most unlikely saviors to enter American fiction in some years, Kiki was born in Arkansas, where she was the victim of unspeakably savage sexual attacks from her father. She is a white woman in her early 30's -- alcoholic, fiercely independent, unpredictable, scary and smart. A tenant in Soupspoon's building, though they have never met, she throws a tantrum over his eviction and insists that he move in with her. She quickly dispatches her sometime boyfriend (a Negro convinced by his mother that he isn't), the landlord and others who stand in her way. Undeterred by Soupspoon's stench, she undresses him, carries him -- despite the pull on her stitches -- to the tub and bathes him. Soup thinks, in concert with the reader: ""Maybe she was crazy. Drunk maybe, or insane."" Yet she shakes loose ""the loneliness that had been his life for years."" 
 ""RL's Dream"" is about Soup's last stand as a musician and how he and Kiki alternate roles of nurturer and invalid. It is a story of the Deep South but set in another country, up north. They live in New York but dream of the piney woods. ""While Soupspoon was counting dead bodies in his sleep, Kiki called out, 'No, daddy.' Her dream was Southern too."" Yet their obsessive recollections have entirely different tenors. Atwater's are elegiac -- even his litanies of violence, murder, racism. ""For all that it was barren, the Delta was a beautiful land too. It was a hard land but true. It had the whippoorwill and the hoot owl and crickets for music. It had pale dead trees that stood out in the moonlight like the hands of dead men reaching out of the ground."" Kiki's are horrific -- she drinks herself into a stupor for fear of remembering. 
 It may be useful, at this point, to assure his many admirers that this is indeed the work of the Walter Mosley who has written four justly celebrated detective novels set in Los Angeles during the 15 years following World War II, and starring the serenely cool and competent Easy Rawlins. In ""RL's Dream,"" Mr. Mosley has risked a lyrical and original -- if imperfect -- leap beyond genre fiction, working for the first time in the third person and substituting an omniscient probing of damaged lives for the modulated fastidiousness of Rawlins. His superb reportorial eye is fully focused on New York's street life as well as the tar-paper bucket-of-blood juke joints of the Delta. Several episodes are as well tuned as anything he has written, including the violent conclusion, and especially a tense and comic tour de force in which Kiki embezzles a million-dollar insurance policy from her company to pay for Soupspoon's chemotherapy. More impressive still is the cast -- excepting a few stock roles (villain, milquetoast), it is mostly original and often credible. 
 STILL, episodes do congeal into misguided sentimentality, underscored by gnomic utterances designed to render Soupspoon a kind of cosmic bluesman. Sitting in the park, Soup meditates on ants and worms. As he begins his observation (""Everybody's doin' their business""), you suddenly recall that his name is Wise and wish it weren't. Wise sayings mount up all too quickly. On music: ""It's all about gettin' so close to pain that it's like a friend, like somebody you love."" On blues: ""Blues is the Devil's music an' we his chirren. RL was Satan's favorite son."" Yet when he considers RL's remark ""They ain't no gettin' away from yo stank, Soup,"" he concludes, ""The words just didn't make sense."" Oh? Unhappily, they make a lot more sense than the examples of Soup's lyrics, most of which are self-consciously arty and even foolish, confirming the reader's suspicion that Mr. Mosley knows very little about the blues or the lives of bluesmen. Incidentally, it is inconceivable that those listening to Soupspoon use the names Robert Johnson and RL interchangeably wouldn't ask why or register confusion. 
 Such moments of unreality, including an episode in which an 18-year-old beauty seduces Soupspoon, are jarring because Mr. Mosley's intonation is usually dead on. By the story's almost too perfect conclusion, you know Kiki -- ""this redheaded white girl, drunk and jagged, who thought slaps were kisses and whisky was milk"" -- well enough to recognize her on the street. The author's pleasure in her is confirmed in the crazily ripe future he gives her. Nor does Mr. Mosley miss a beat with Randy, her black boyfriend who thinks he's Egyptian; or Mavis, Soup's former wife and once RL's lover, who inhabits an apartment decorated entirely in white and is still mourning her 5-year-old son. The boy's accidental death half a century ago was indirectly related to the rowdy night Mavis spent dancing to RL and Soupspoon in a juke joint. 
 Mavis tells Kiki you can't plan your life no matter how hard you try, and that, in part, is the subject of ""RL's Dream."" Even as he regains his strength to put on an old-time fancy suit for one last musical job in a low-down back-alley gambling joint, Soupspoon Wise realizes his life was a mirage, a dream, and not even his own dream. ""I never played the blues, not really,"" he says. ""I run after it all these years. I scratched at its coattails and copied some notes. But the real blues is covered by mud and blood in the Mississippi Delta. The real blues is down that terrible passway where RL traveled, sufferin' an' singin' till he was dead. I followed him up to the gateway, but Satan scared me silly and left me back to cry.""  Gary Giddins, a staff writer at The Village Voice, is writing a biography of Bing Crosby. His most recent book is ""Faces in the Crowd: Players and Writers,"" a collection of critical essays."

 To the Editor: 
 We recently went from Vienna to Prague by train. Our travel agent had arranged to have us picked up at the railroad station. Alas, nobody came. After waiting for an hour I heard a gentleman giving instructions in English. When I asked him where and how to get a taxi, he told us that many of them overcharge and volunteered to take us to our hotel by Metro. 
 Not only did he go out of his way, but he also carried our two heavy suitcases all the way to the lobby of the hotel. It turned out that he was a Czech scientist who just wanted to do a good deed. 
 Such kindness deserves public recognition, especially in times when one mostly hears of holdups and misdeeds against tourists. JOSEPH BAUER  Flushing, Queens"

 The Sommeliers' New Wine 
 Wine and food lovers are in for a treat on Saturday from 2 to 4 P.M. at Sherry-Lehmann, the wine shop at 679 Madison Avenue (61st Street). Two award-winning sommeliers, Daniel Johnnes of Montrachet in TriBeCa and Larry Stone of Rubicon in San Francisco, have released a California cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay with their own new label, Deux Chapeaux. The wines will be available for tasting along with samplings of food prepared by Chris Gesualdi, the chef at Montrachet. New Health-Food Store 
 Finally, there are health-food stores that are really about food -- not just cereals, canned stuff and supplements. One of them is the Natural Frontier Market, 167 Third Avenue (at 16th Street). Near the front of this store, which opened a few months ago, is an inviting produce section. Most items are organic -- labels indicate those that are not -- and prices are fairly reasonable. Both the organic and the non-organic eggplants are $1.49 a pound. 
 The salad bar, $3.99 a pound, has mostly non-organic items. But many of the salads and baked goods at the prepared food counter are made from organic ingredients. Studying Cheese 
 Among the classes scheduled this fall at New York University's Center for Foods and Food Management is one devoted to cheese. On Nov. 2, from 6:10 to 9 P.M., a guided cheese tasting will be led by Robert Kaufelt, who owns Murray's Cheese Shop in Greenwich Village. The class is $45. To register: (212) 998-5588. Pasta Before the Kickoff 
 The dish for a tailgate picnic before the kickoff might be pasta in the shape of the team's mascot or logo. The Pasta Shoppe in Nashville has pastas representing 30 colleges and universities, including the Big 10 schools, Notre Dame and Vanderbilt. Ivy League schools are not represented. Some pastas, which come in six-ounce bags for $2.95 each, are in team colors. Notre Dame is green and white, for example. The pastas can be ordered by calling (800) 247-0188; there is a charge for shipping.  Greenwich Catering 
 In November, Debra Ponzek, the former chef at Montrachet in TriBeCa, will open a catering shop in Greenwich, Conn. Called Aux Delices: Food by Debra Ponzek, it will be at 1075 East Putnam Road, in the Riverside section. The shop will sell an array of dishes, with daily specials, plus pastries and bread. Catering will also be available. Off the Menu Array of International Openings 
 Several new restaurants have just opened, or are opening in the next week or so, and they are a diverse collection. 
 Torre di Pisa, 19 West 44th Street, a branch of a restaurant in Milan owned by Paolo and Marco Meacci, has a David Rockwell design that incorporates references to the leaning landmark for which the restaurant is named. It is due to open Oct. 11. 
 Riodizio, 417 Lafayette Street (Astor Place), is scheduled to open on Saturday and will have an open kitchen in the back, where meats, seafood, poultry, vegetables and game will be grilled on skewers, then served in unlimited quantities. It will be the first Manhattan version of a Brazilian rodizio. A rodizio dinner, including salads and side dishes, will be $18.95 ($17.95 at lunch); doggie bags will not be provided. The restaurant will also have an a la carte menu. 
 Republic, which will specialize in noodles, dumplings and other simple fare interpreted from an array of Asian countries, is planning to open on Monday at 37 Union Square West (near 17th Street). 
 Serious Chinese food is on the menu at Jimmy Sung's, 219 East 44th Street. In May, Mr. Sung sold J. Sung's Dynasty in the Hotel Lexington, which he had owned since 1986. His new restaurant, lavishly decorated, offers dishes from various regions in China. 
 Willow, with contemporary food that suggests the Mediterranean, is to open today in the duplex space at 1022 Lexington Avenue (73d Street). The owners, Lauri Gibson and Vivek Bandhu, also own Table d'Hote on East 92d Street.  Food and Drink at La Cote Basque

 Wladyslaw Otton Biernacki-Poray, an architect who founded and designed the American Research Hospital for Children in Krakow, Poland, died on Wednesday in  Warsaw, where he was on a business trip. He was 71 and lived in Montclair, N.J. 
 The cause was a heart attack, said his daughter, Krystyna Poray-Goddu. 
 Mr. Biernacki-Poray was born in Lwow, Poland, now Lvov, Ukraine. He joined the Polish Army in 1939 and, after spending time as a Russian prisoner, served with the Second Polish Corps of the British Eighth Army in the Middle East and Italy. He received decorations for valor in the battle of Monte Cassino, Italy,  where he was wounded. 
 After studying architecture at the University of Rome and Polish University College in London, Mr. Biernacki-Poray worked as an architect in Britain. In 1952 he came to the United States, where he worked for the Manhattan architects  Howard T. Fisher & Associates before starting his own company, Biernacki-Poray & Associates, in 1955. 
 In 1958, he persuaded Senators Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota and Jacob K. Javits of New York, both Democrats, to lead an effort to amend the Battle Act of 1950, which prevented the United States Government from spending Polish currency to build anything in Communist Poland. The United States had acquired the money  from sales of surplus agricultural products. 
 The amended act allowed the money to be used to the children's hospital, which was completed in 1965.

 PARKING Delivered, Presumably, Dent-Free In a test run in Augsburg, Germany, an automatic rotating disc brought three cars to their parking slots. The promised waiting time at this fancy new garage: 2.5 minutes PUBLISHING  Those Business Week Papers Let's see. First Procter & Gamble sued Bankers Trust, saying it had been led down a too-risky investment path. A mass of papers quickly piled up -- lawyers tend to be good at that -- and a judge decided some of them weren't quite ready for public consumption. Then Business Week got hold of the sealed papers and smelled a scoop, a judge said no, and all sorts of First Amendment hell broke loose. Last week some smoke cleared, as the judge unsealed the documents, which seemed to bolster P.&G.'s case by disclosing losses at other companies from derivatives sold by Bankers Trust. But the free-speech issue was left smoldering, for the judge also insisted he had the right to stop publication. Now it's in the lap of the appeals courts.  CHARITY  Throwing Big Money at Cancer  It's all too familiar these days: a takeover, a merger, a little board-room back-scratching, and some executive walks away with a sum that would boggle the mind even if it lost a couple of zeroes. But last week came a stunning variation: the mind-numbing sum was going not to an executive but to science. Jon Huntsman, who made about $1 billion in chemicals, lost both parents to cancer and battled it twice himself. That was enough to prod him to say he'd give $100 million to a cancer research center at the University of Utah. That may be walking-around money to Ted Turner, but it's the largest individual gift ever to medical research. ""It's been 26 years since a man walked on the moon,"" Mr. Huntsman said, and we're still battling cancer. He wants to win this one. AUTOS  Speaking Out at Chrysler  The seat belts are off at Chrysler. Last week the chairman, Robert Eaton, lashed out at those he said wanted to ""trash"" the company -- mainly Kirk Kerkorian and Jerome York. He said Mr. Kerkorian, who now owns nearly 15 percent of Chrysler, ""has no real knowledge"" about what's happening and is merely out for ""personal gain."" He said Mr. Kerkorian and Mr. York -- the former Chrysler executive who's now in Mr. Kerkorian's camp -- are merely harming other shareholders by trying to gain control. 
 REAL ESTATE  Japanese for 'Low Rent'  Japanese real estate prices are so high they're almost an international joke (so long as someone else is paying them). So when you hear that they've plummeted -- by two-thirds or more -- in recent years, does that mean they're out of the stratosphere? Not exactly. You'll still spend $6,000 or so (every month!) to rent a modest suburban house, perhaps $4,000 for a one-bedroom Tokyo apartment; this is Japanese for ""plummet."" And it may not even last. Last week the I.M.F. forecast a recovery for the battered Japanese economy in 1996, though it did lower its estimate for the nation's growth this year. Rent 'em while you can. CAREERS  The Mailroom Gambit  It is, so it's said, the American way: if you're near the top of your field, you make a good living. So you'd think that Jay Bonin, who's in the top 200 or so Americans in his chosen field, would be riding high. If he'd been a lawyer, he might have been one of the hundreds of that profession at the Simpson defense table; if he played baseball, he'd be out there spitting with the richest of them. But Mr. Bonin's great talent is chess. Yes, there's $1 million in prize money in the world championship match that was speeding toward a conclusion last week atop the World Trade Center, but in chess, if you're not at that pinnacle, you'd better have a day job. Mr. Bonin, brilliant at chess, makes a few thousand a year at it; by day, he's a mailroom clerk. INNOVATIONS  Making Cats Easier to Love  There are, those tireless statisticians tell us, 63 million cats in this country. There'd be a lot fewer if it weren't for one Edward Lowe. Cats, you see, smell. Built for the desert, they use water with enviable efficiency, but the downside is that their urine . . . well, you know. To fight the odor, people tried sawdust, sand, wood shavings, but they weren't much help. Then one day in 1947 -- a watershed day in feline history -- Mr. Lowe had a neighbor try a dried, granulated clay used to sop up grease spills in factories. And, yes, Kitty Litter was born -- along with what is now a $600 million annual industry. And Mr. Lowe? In 1990 he sold his business for $200 million. And last week he died at age 75. OPPORTUNITIES  Gulps of Premium Juice  Who has the most impact on this marvelous capitalist machine we inhabit? Well, one week it might be Bill Gates, the next week Newt Gingrich, and the next, Steven Spielberg. Last week, of course, it was 12 faceless jurors in a Los Angeles courtroom. They spoke, and this mighty economy -- which prides itself on packing every second chock full -- ground to a halt for long, long minutes. You could have heard a stock drop, if any had been trading; you could have heard the phone ring, if anyone had called. The jurors spoke, and whole conglomerates were born -- reported $1 million sales of photos of the reunion of the defendant (what was his name?) and his children, tales of $50 million pay-per-view blowout interviews, other interview deals, book deals, and then probably books about the book deals. And, yes, talk of a television drama series based on the lives of two DNA experts. And it's only just begun.  HEALTH CARE  Medicare Plan Under Fire  Medicare may well need patching up, but the Republicans' notions about how to do it took a lot of flak last week. First came the American Medical Association, which has kept silent for much of the recent debate but now voiced concern that limits on payments would scare too many doctors away. ""It would be a major blow,"" said an A.M.A. spokesman. Then the A.A.R.P. joined the fray, saying Congress was cutting ""too much, too fast"" from projected spending. Newt Gingrich has been trying to get the elderly on his side, but he doesn't seem to have succeeded. And in a final attack, the head of the American College of Physicians said bluntly, ""We are not on board."""
"216","Kukrit Pramoj, Thai Ex-Prime Minister, Dies at 84",796413,"|obituaries",10,10,1995,"19951010T000000","|THAILAND"," 
 Kukrit Pramoj, a former Prime Minister of Thailand who steered the country through a difficult and politically dangerous period after the end of the Vietnam War, died yesterday in Bangkok. He was 84 and had been hospitalized for heart disease and diabetes. 
 Mr. Kukrit -- who was usually addressed with the noble title of Mom Rajawong because he was the son of a royal prince -- was one of Thailand's most colorful, outspoken and versatile characters. He co-founded a newspaper and wrote political commentary, mastered classical Thai dancing and opened a school to teach it to younger generations, acted in a film -- ""The Ugly American"" with Marlon Brando -- and remained an unashamedly opinionated elder statesman until the end of his life. 
 It was as a defender of nascent Thai democracy in the 1970's that Mr. Kukrit is best remembered by historians of contemporary Southeast Asia. Prime Minister for only 14 months in 1975-1976, he faced the collapse of South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia to Communist movements, which many believed would soon threaten Thailand. 
 But Mr. Kukrit, rejecting the domino theory, established diplomatic relations with China and asked American troops to leave the huge bases from which they had mounted much of the war in Vietnam. 
 These bold steps were popular with Thai intellectuals, particularly leftists who had a influence on his thinking, John Bresnan, executive director of the Pacific Basin studies program at Columbia University, said yesterday. But his policies quickly provoked a conservative backlash. Mr. Kukrit and his Social Action Party were defeated in an election in 1976 that he had called in the hope of strengthening his political hand. 
 While Prime Minister, Mr. Kukrit tried to build a democratic polity strong enough to resist persistent pressures from the Thai Army, which has staged repeated coups over more than half a century. As late as 1987, when he was in his 70's, he was still defying the generals. After a speech in which he accused the military of trying to establish the equivalent of a Communist-style ""politburo"" to run the country, 250 ill-disciplined Thai Army rangers, troops known for violent behavior, arrived in buses from the remote northeast and tried to break into his home to threaten him. 
 When the Army commander, Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who is now Defense Minister, did not discipline the troops, a storm of criticism arose in the ever-bolder Thai press. Students from 21 institutions of higher education -- precursors of the student leaders and young professionals who would take to the streets to defend democracy in 1992 -- came to his home with bouquets of flowers, a touching, traditional Thai way of showing respect or making amends. 
 Mr. Kukrit was born on April 20, 1911, and was educated in Thailand and at Oxford University. At 25, he married Pakpring Tongyai and they had two children: a son, Rongrit, and a daughter, Visumitra. His political career began in 1946 with his election to the Thai Parliament. Several years later he co-founded the Thai-language newspaper Siam Rath. He did not withdraw formally from politics until about four years ago. 
 A quiet nationalist -- his dog barked only at Westerners, he would tell visitors with a chuckle -- Mr. Kukrit became a strong advocate of holding on to Thai traditions in architecture, language and the arts while others were rushing into the Westernization that accompanied a phenomenal economic takeoff. In the center of booming Bangkok, surrounded by rising concrete apartment blocks and offices, he lived in a classical Thai house built of tropical wood, and filled it with Thai treasures. He set a powerful, if increasingly lonely, example. 
 ""We Thai can lead a life that is genuinely Thai and be quite happy about it,"" he said in an interview in 1987. ""We don't have to live in Western houses or employ Western methods in our daily lives. If we were to limit ourselves to just being Thai people, I think we would be happier all around."" 
 In addition to his immediate family, Mr. Kukrit is survived by a brother, Seni Pramoj, 90, also a former Prime Minister."
"217","Peter Wisher, 84, Who Created a Dance Genre for the Deaf, Dies",797497,"|obituaries",13,10,1995,"19951013T000000",NA," 
 Peter R. Wisher, a former Gallaudet University athletic coach who was so struck by the graceful flow of his students' sign language that he choreographed their hand movements into an acclaimed genre of dance for the deaf, died on Sunday at the Veterans Hospital in Washington. He was 84. 
 Mr. Wisher had been recuperating from injuries suffered in an automobile accident last April. 
 Before he took up his position as coach and professor of physical education at Gallaudet, the school for the deaf in Washington, Mr. Wisher, a former assistant basketball coach at the University of Maryland, spent the summer of 1955 learning American Sign Language. 
 But it was not until that fall, when he watched Gallaudet students signing the Lord's Prayer in a campus ceremony, that he had a vision of the hands as bodies on a stage. 
 In short order he created a new form of dance, one marked by large, exaggerated movements involving hands, arms and bodies. Although the prayer and countless other works that followed are perceived by most hearing audiences as dance, to those who know American Sign Language they are also opera since the dancers, moving in synchronization with the music they never hear, use the movement of their bodies to sign the lyrics they cannot sing. 
 Mr. Wisher's students, whose previous forays into dance had been limited to private, often furtive, mimicry of standard dance forms, were so enchanted by his initial exercises in choreography that he formed the college's first performing dance troupe, the Gallaudet Dance Company. 
 By the time he retired as athletic director in 1981, successive versions of the company had made national and international tours and performed on television. 
 For Mr. Wisher, an all-around athlete who coached everything from swimming to wrestling, the leap from athletics to dance was hardly a stretch. 
 He and his wife, Anne, had been involved in dance since their days on the gymnastics team at East Stroudsburg State College in Pennsylvania. 
 ""We even operated a Fred Astaire dance studio,"" Mrs. Wisher said yesterday, recalling that she and her husband also spent a summer at Connecticut College in the late 1940's studying with some of the greats of modern dance including Martha Graham, Charles Weidman and Doris Humphrey. 
 Indeed, Mr. Wisher, who obtained a master's degree and a doctorate in physical education from Penn State University, regarded dance as such an integral part of the athletic experience that his doctoral thesis was ""A Modern Dance Manual for Male Teachers of Physical Education."" 
 In a peripatetic coaching career, he routinely used dance both as a training regimen and as a full-fledged sport, often selecting the burliest athletes and transforming them into a performing dance troupe. 
 ""He wanted to counter the idea that men's dancing was somehow sissified,"" Mrs. Wisher explained. 
 Mr. Wisher, whose high school specialties had been diving, hurdling, pole vaulting and high jumping, did not see dance so much as a form of athletics as he saw athletics as a variation of dance. 
 ""Movement,"" he once said, ""was the prime interest in my life."" 
 Mr. Wisher, the son of a Polish immigrant, was born in Shenandoah, Pa. His original name was Wiskersky, but he changed it after college, his wife said, as the only way he could get a job in an era of ethnic prejudice. 
 His father was killed in a coal mining accident when Mr. Wisher was 6, qualifying the youngster for a free primary and secondary education at the Girard College boarding school in Philadelphia, an experience he attributed to changing the course of his life. 
 ""He always said that if it hadn't been for Girard he would have become a coal miner, too,"" Mrs. Wisher said. 
 Mr. Wisher, who served in the Navy during World War II and was coaching at Maryland when he was recalled to active duty during the Korean conflict, came to Gallaudet by accident. 
 ""Maryland saved his job for him, but not his seniority,"" said his wife, recalling that her husband was so miffed by what he saw as an injustice that he started looking for another job and found one at Gallaudet, a college he had never heard of. 
 Mr. Wisher had also never known a deaf person before. It gave him a certain advantage at a time when sign language was actively discouraged by traditional educators of the deaf, and the belief that those who could not hear music could not dance was so ingrained that it took someone who did not know any better to show the deaf and the world otherwise. 
 In addition to his wife, of College Park, Md., he is survived by a daughter, Judee Thompson-Judy of Waldorf, Md.; a sister, Anna Benjamin of Forty Fort, Pa., and a brother, Anthony Wisher of Reading, Pa."

 A buyout offer is a bribe to leave. Compared with outright dismissal or a companywide pay cut, it is more humane, but more expensive for the company. 
 Still, a buyout helps insure that workers who stay are not so demoralized by  the exodus that productivity is harmed. Shabby treatment of those who leave guarantees poor morale, benefits consultants say. 
 The company is not giving money away in a buyout, however generous it might seem,"" said John Haley, national retirement practices director at Wilson Wyatt,  a consultant in Washington. ""It's usually a very sound business decision."" 
 Charles F. Albrecht Jr., president of Drake Beam Morin Inc., a human-resources consultant in Manhattan, says employees should keep one thing in mind. 
 ""If they're offering you a buyout in the first place,"" he said, ""you're either talking about a company that is not financially robust or about which there will be a giant question mark about operating costs for some time."" Staying may be the poorest choice of all. 
 For younger employees, a buyout can be a windfall and an opportunity to find  a better, more satisfying job; for older employees already close to retirement,  the cash is gravy. But for those too young to retire and too old to find a new job quickly, a buyout plan can be full of puzzling and potentially costly choices. 
 A buyout typically consists of a lump-sum payment, worth from a few months to a full year of salary, but rarely more; often a continuation of medical benefits for up to a year after leaving the company, but rarely longer, and sometimes an allowance for retraining and relocation, which can be generous. 
 The toughest elements to evaluate are the pension sweeteners, the additions to chronological age and years of service that qualify you for a larger pension, but hardly ever for a full one. 
 The offer made to 72,000 AT&T employees (that's down from 77,800; 5,800 offers were found to be duplicates) is a fairly standard package.  AT&T is certain to take a big charge against earnings, as it did when the company offered a voluntary package to 125,000 white-collar employees in 1989, about 12,500 employees accepted, and the quarterly charge totaled $98 million. 
 Despite the multimillion-dollar cost of these voluntary programs, they pay for themselves in one to two years, sometimes three, benefits consultants say. 
 A lump-sum payment, seemingly the most straightforward feature, can carry several surprises. Assume a payment of $50,000. 
 ""Young people who haven't dealt with a relatively large sum of money think it is a lot more than it really is,"" said Diahann Lassus, a principal and financial planner at Lassus Wherley & Associates in New Providence, N.J. 
 After Federal taxes of about $16,500 and Social Security taxes of $3,500, that sum is actually $30,000 before the state and local tax bite. You could take the lump sum while you are still on the payroll and thus reduce the Social Security bite (but this might mean higher Federal taxes), Ms. Lassus said. 
 You could also take the lump sum and spread it over 24 months or longer, thus reducing taxes but doing little to pay for groceries and the rent or mortgage. 
 Whatever is left you may decide to invest. But don't expect a windfall there  either. Mary Merrill, a financial planner at Financial Advisory Service in Madison, Wis., said many clients, seeing the stock market's current strength, expected an annual return of more than 10 percent. 
 A more reasonable assumption might be 6 or 7 percent. 
 The bigger surprise can be in pension benefits. A 56-year-old bank executive  and client of Lewis J. Altfest, a financial planner in Manhattan, considered taking a buyout to move to a higher-paying job at a financial services company.  But Mr. Altfest calculated that the banker would lose $300,000 in pension benefits. The banker stayed put. 
 For an independent assessment, it might pay to consult a financial planner. But that also has a cost. Mr. Altfest, the crack planner, charges $250 an hour.

 What does it feel like to win a week for once? People at CBS found out yesterday, when Nielsen numbers showed that the network had finished first in the prime-time ratings race last week -- for the first time this season. 
 ""It's very good for morale,"" said Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Entertainment. 
 CBS had an 11.4 average Nielsen rating for the week. (Each rating point equals 959,000 homes.) NBC had 10.6, ABC 9.4 and Fox a 7.7. 
 For February -- a ""sweeps"" month -- CBS nosed out ABC for second-place behind the mighty NBC. NBC won the month with a 12.2 average. CBS's average was 10.5, ABC's was 10.2, and Fox's was 8.0. 
 CBS did well with the Grammy Awards last Wednesday (14.6 rating), and a Friday special, ""Sergei Grinkov: Celebration of a Life"" (10.3), featuring the young figure skater Yekaterina Gordeyeva and other skating stars in a tribute to her husband and pairs partner, Mr. Grinkov, who died of a heart attack in November. 
 But David F. Poltrack, CBS's vice president of research, said the average rating for CBS's regularly scheduled shows was higher (10.8) than its overall rating (10.5) in February's sweeps. 
 ""We've got a solid Saturday, Sunday and Monday now,"" Mr. Poltrack said. Which makes it easier to forget about the show that was supposed to herald a new, younger, more glitzy CBS: ""Central Park West."" The series went on, with much fanfare, last fall, and flopped. It was put on hiatus, and now network officials say it will probably be a summer replacement.

"224","Ex-Vichy Aide Says He Is Scapegoat for French Guilt in Holocaust",834932,"|world",7,3,1996,"19960307T000000","|FRANCE"," 
 Fighting a move to bring him to trial 13 years after his first indictment on  charges he ordered the deportation of hundreds of Jews from France to a Nazi death camp during World War II, a former French Cabinet minister said in an interview published today that he was a scapegoat for French complicity in the Holocaust. 
 Maurice Papon, 85, who was secretary general of the collaborationist Vichy regime in the southwest Gironde region, told the daily Liberation that he had had no power to resist Nazi orders during the German occupation. 
 Mr. Papon's wartime actions had been largely forgotten until they were recalled in 1981 by Le Canard Enchaine, a French weekly. At the time, Mr. Papon  was Budget Minister under President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. He resigned and was indicted in 1983. After those charges were dismissed on a technicality, he was indicted again in 1988. 
 Mr. Papon, who later joined the Resistance toward the end of the war, has been free and living quietly in Paris while the case worked its way through courts. 
 Hearings began today at a Bordeaux appeals court on whether finally to bring  Mr. Papon to trial on charges he organized the deportation of 1,690 Jews from Bordeaux between 1942 and 1944. A ruling is expected to take several months, and Mr. Papon's lawyers said they would appeal a decision to set a date for trial. 
 Mr. Papon, who was police prefect in Paris when more than 200 Algerians demonstrating for independence were killed in clashes with the police in 1961, told Liberation that he had been put on trial because some people could not forgive him for having a successful postwar career. 
 Prosecutors assert that Mr. Papon was responsible for deporting Jews that ended up in the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz. Mr. Papon denies the charges, and  he said today that documents he signed attesting to the arrests of Jews by the French police and to their expulsion from the country were simply reports to his superiors of events he had observed, not of orders being executed. 
 ""It was a very secondary, very minor post,"" Mr. Papon said, referring to his  position in the Vichy regime. He said he had merely submitted reports to his superiors on roundups of Jews that the German authorities had made or had ordered the Vichy police to make, and that he had always tried to help the victims, not persecute them. 
 About 76,000 of the 320,000 Jews in France during the war were deported to Nazi camps, most of them by French police. Few survived."
"225","Chinese Seek Atom Option To Fend Off Asteroids",846512,"|world",27,4,1996,"19960427T000000","|CHINA|RUSSIA|CHINA"," 
 When President Boris N. Yeltsin declared on Thursday, somewhat prematurely as it turned out, that he had persuaded China to sign a treaty banning nuclear weapons testing forever, he was unaware of China's position on the ""asteroid threat"" and the need for ""peaceful nuclear explosions"" to combat it. 
 The Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, told Mr. Yeltsin that China favored concluding a treaty this year. On the basis of his statement, Mr. Yeltsin announced what he thought was very good news, especially after President Clinton had personally requested that he try to win Chinese support for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
 China made its position clear before and after a meeting between the two leaders -- but not during the meeting. 
 ""The door to peaceful nuclear explosions should not be closed, at least not now,"" the Foreign Ministry said the day before Mr. Yeltsin's arrival for three days of meetings in China.  And, again, after Mr. Yeltsin asserted that China had been won over, the Foreign Ministry quickly deflated that news, declaring that its reservations stand. 
 No one can quite understand it, but China is arguing that mankind needs to keep developing ""peaceful"" nuclear weapons in case a giant asteroid is discovered careering through space on a collision course with the earth. 
 ""Only China is thinking about the future of mankind,"" said a European diplomat here, rolling his eyes, as he repeated the Chinese argument that nuclear detonations might be needed on -- or above -- the planet. 
 Beijing's stand may delay the signing of what would be one of the most important final steps in the control of nuclear weapons. The United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, has suggested that a fitting venue for a historic signing ceremony of the nuclear test ban treaty would be Hiroshima, Japan, site of the first wartime detonation of an atomic weapon. 
 China emphasized the asteroid idea but said that nuclear weapons might also come in handy for other projects like: digging long tunnels or channels for irrigation, or creatinghuge reservoirs to store oil underground or water above ground; they might also be used to combat global climate changes or threats humans have yet to experience -- like killer asteroids. 
 Astronomers know of about 200 asteroids that are likely to cross the Earth's  path sometime in the ages ahead and are looking for more, estimating that there  are perhaps as many as 1,700 whizzing through the solar system that could wreak  global havoc by exploding with the force of a million nuclear weapons or more. However, the chances of such a collision anytime soon are slim; they occur perhaps once every 300,000 years or so. 
 Some weapons scientists in the United States have argued that rocket interceptors should be made ready to nudge doomsday rocks off course with a nuclear blast, but they have generally been ignored, with a consensus favoring better searches of the heavens to gauge the potential threat. 
 Of course, any weapon that could shoot down an asteroid might have military utility as an anti-satellite weapon, something China has hinted it would develop if the United States, Japan and Taiwan build ballistic missile defense systems around China's periphery, as each nation has begun to discuss. 
 The Clinton Administration and Congress are in agreement about the need to develop ballistic missile defenses in Asia. Japanese leaders have delicately explained to Beijing that they are looking at the ""feasibility"" of such a defensive network. Such systems would depend heavily on satellites. 
 China's representative at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, Sha Zukang, in late March spelled out China's call for an exemption to the test ban  treaty. ""No country can impose its will on China under any circumstances,"" he said. 
 But China's reluctance to move forward comes at a time when Beijing is harboring deep suspicions about American intentions and about future military cooperation between the United States and Japan. 
 In a rather startling assertion last week, the official Communist Party newspaper, The People's Daily, asserted: ""The strategic objective of the United  States is to dominate the world."" It went on to say that that the United States  ""will not tolerate the emergence of a strong nation on the Eurasian landmass that would threaten its dominant position."" 
 Some Western officials say China is nurturing a ""grievance strategy"" toward the United States and is holding the test ban negotiations hostage as Beijing awaits the outcome of several confrontations with Washington over human rights,  copyright piracy by Chinese industries and illicit Chinese assistance to Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. 
 ""China does not appear to be in the mood to conclude any kind of agreement with the United States until things unfold further,"" said one Western diplomat.  Until then, he said, there is likely to be more talk of the need for nuclear weapons to control asteroids.

 Chinese-Russian Border Pact 
 SHANGHAI, April 26 (By The New York Times) -- The Presidents of Russia and China and representatives of three other nations signed an agreement here today  to secure borders in Central Asia, and underline the bonds between Moscow and Beijing. 
 Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan also signed the pact, which spells out steps to avoid conflict, specifying that each nation must inform a neighbor about any major military exercises or movements within 60 miles of a border. 
 For China, drawing attention to its improving relations with Russia and its Asian neighbors is an easy way to tell Washington that Beijing has other options in seeking allies. 
 Since there have been no serious border clashes in recent years, however, the agreement was more a declaration among friends. 
 At one point, Mr. Yeltsin compared Chinese Communists, his new best friends,  with Russian Communists, his bitter rivals: ""Our Communists are fanatics; Communists here are pragmatists."" 
 When he came to Shanghai, Mr. Yeltsin brought his political campaign with him. The Chinese were happy to stage a series of photo opportunities almost guaranteed to play well back in Russia, where elections are scheduled for June."

 Isabel Allende and Nicolas Frias ISABEL ALLENDE, novelist: In 1992, my daughter Paula, died of a rare disease after a painful year. A few days later, Nicolas and I went ot ea gorest of wedwoods and scattered her ashes. Through a veil of tears, I saw that my son had suddenly grown six feet tall adn was wrapping me in his arms, and no words were  needed. Looking at this photograph, I realized that Nicolas has been holding me  much longer than I ever held him. Paul Kissinger and Henry Kissinger PUALA KISSINGER, avid reader: When Henry went to war, I wrote every other day, and he answered three times a week. When he finally returned, there were parties and, to crown it all, the visits to the White House to meet the various Presidents, the mother proud on the arm of her son. HENRY KISSINGER, former Secretary of State: The happiest times of my childhood were spent at her family's house. Much as been written about how traumatic a period this was supposed to have been in my life. But my mother shielded us from much of what was for her, in fact, traumatic. At every crucial stage of my life I have been lucky to have had my mother at my side. 
 Ruth Bader Ginsburg and James Ginsburg  JAMES GINSBURG, classical-record producer: As a child growing up, I always wondered why people only asked me what my father did for a living. Eventually, it dawned on me that having a mother as well established in her profession as her husband was unusual. Yet Mom managed to find the time to do all the things a mother was supposed to do. The main difference, I suppose, was that when other children woke up in the middle of the night, they probably didn't find their mothers at the dining-room table reading stacks of legal papers and sipping eight-hour-old coffee. Marian Wright Edelman and Joshua and Ezra Edelman JOSHUA EDELMAN, teacher: Growing up, I always wished that I had a normal mother. My perception was that my mom was always traveling around and speaking to strange people. She was also always strict with me. I wanted a mom who would allow me to hang out late and go to parties. In retrospect, I realize how lucky  I am to have had a moral exemplar to inculcate in me the ability to distinguish  between right and wrong, and the exigency to give back to those who often need the most guidance-children.

"227","House Republican Leaders Return D'Amato's Salvo on Strategies",848822,"|u.s.|washington",6,5,1996,"19960506T000000",NA," 
 Speaker Newt Gingrich and his loyal No. 2, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, returned fire today at criticism leveled against the policies and practices of the House Republicans they lead. They were not, however, responding to some partisan salvo from Democrats but to the rather blunt criticism last week from Alfonse M. D'Amato, New York's Republican Senator. 
 On Friday, Mr. D'Amato complained that Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, was being hurt by his association with Mr. Gingrich. Today, Mr. Gingrich said Mr. D'Amato was ""just wrong."" 
 I don't know why he is wandering around saying these things,"" Mr. Gingrich  said on the CBS News program ""Face the Nation."" 
 On another talk show, Mr. Armey, the House Republican leader, was far harsher, suggesting a motive for Mr. D'Amato: that the Senator was trying to shore up his political standing in New York, where he faces re-election in two years. 
 Mr. Gingrich, returning to the talk-show circuit after an absence of several  months, used the occasion to attack President Clinton as well. On the balanced budget, he said Mr. Clinton ""postures, says things that are false and has zero interest in a real agreement."" 
 And in vetoing a bill that would ban certain late-term abortions, Mr. Gingrich said, ""Bill Clinton has taken an extraordinarily extreme position, that it is O.K. to kill children in ways in which no American could tolerate if they  knew about them."" 
 David Eichenbaum, communications director of the Democratic National Committee, said: ""Nasty Newt is back, and he's nastier than ever. The better the economic news, the nastier Newt gets."" 
 With polls showing Mr. Dole trailing President Clinton by wide margins, it has been a season of discontent for Republicans with the sprouting of intraparty feuds. 
 But unlike the disagreements among Republicans over issues like the minimum wage and the gas tax, the D'Amato-Gingrich argument is over how Mr. Dole should  shape his case to be President and how closely he should be identified with Mr.  Gingrich's aggressive approach. 
 Mr. D'Amato is a leading figure in the Dole campaign, and his criticism reverberated throughout Republican circles. His complaints that Mr. Gingrich misread his mandate from the 1994 elections were explicit and frequent in New York on Friday. 
 Mr. Gingrich said: ""I would simply say to Al D'Amato that we favor balancing  the Federal budget so that our children aren't crushed by debt. I think 80 percent of the American people favor that."" He said most people also endorsed the House Republican efforts to enact death penalty laws and tax cuts. 
 Mr. Armey, speaking on the NBC News program ""Meet the Press,"" said Mr. D'Amato's ""mama apparently didn't teach him not to bite the hand that feeds him."" He said the Contract With America, the House Republicans' campaign manifesto from 1994, gave the Republicans majorities in both the House and the Senate, making Mr. D'Amato chairman of the banking committee. 
 ""I'm sorry he doesn't recognize that,"" Mr. Armey said. ""But he's behind in the polls, and you know when politicians get behind in the polls they get desperate, and Al obviously wanted to endear himself to big labor. They're spending a ton of money in New York."""
"228","Metro Matters;Youth Crime: Should Laws Be Tougher?",849378,"|new york|region",9,5,1996,"19960509T000000","|NEW YORK STATE"," 
 YOU could almost hear a collective gasp emanating from the portraits of venerable lawyers lining the walls of the City Bar Association meeting hall the  other night when a speaker first uttered the term. ""Superpredators!"" 
 It has shock value all right. And it solves a little puzzle. For those New Yorkers wondering why their Governor wants to get tougher on juvenile crime -- even though the headlines blare news of a persistently dropping crime rate -- here is one answer. It is fear of the future and of superpredators -- a term in  vogue among some criminologists who are predicting a sharp increase in violent crime in the next few years as the number of teen-agers soars. 
 A ""ticking time bomb,"" a report by law enforcement experts called the coming population jump -- a 23 percent increase in 14- to 17-year-old males by 2005 --  a serious problem because the rate of violent crime among teen-agers has soared, even as crime among adults has gone down. 
 So New York is getting ready. Gov. George E. Pataki has made recommendations  for getting tougher with young criminals, as well as with adults, and while it seemed for a while that the proposals could slip through without public debate,  they surely are getting attention now as experts discuss them in tones close to  apocalyptic. 
 ""It's time -- we must prepare for the onslaught of juvenile violence,"" Peter  Reinharz, a lawyer for the city, said during a panel discussion on a recent night at the City Bar Association in midtown, citing the growing use of the term superpredators. 
 THAT upset Michael A. Corriero, an acting State Supreme Court justice presiding over Manhattan's youth part. ""We are not dealing with superpredators,"" he said. ""We are dealing with children, 14 and 15-year-old children. We cannot demonize and dehumanize children."" 
 Not so, said Paul Shechtman, Mr. Pataki's criminal justice director. The Governor's recommendations, making the rounds in Albany, include increasing many minimum sentences for juvenile offenders; transferring all 16-year-olds in detention centers run by the State Division for Youth to the regular prison system, and sharply increasing sentences for once-convicted youths who commit a  serious felony. 
 Supporters say the proposals would make the streets safer by putting violent  youths behind bars. Opponents say imprisoning them with hardened criminals would make them more violent. ""You can't keep them in forever,"" said Philip B. Uninsky, senior attorney for Statewide Youth Advocacy. ""We know that the longer  the time served, the more dangerous kids become."" 
 MR. REINHARZ, chief of the Family Court Division of the city's Law Department, said New York had little choice. ""Let's put it this way,"" he said after the panel discussion, explaining that he was speaking for himself, not as a city official. ""There is another wave of juvenile crime coming. There are going to be a lot more people after the turn of the century in the teen-age range. There are predictions out there and the question is whether we are prepared if that happens. If it does not, what have we lost?"" 
 A lot, Justice Corriero and other critics argue. ""Don't get me wrong,"" he said. ""I put 15-year-olds away for life. But they're saying we're expecting this incredible bubble of juvenile violence, so let's build more jails, let's increase sentences."" If the assumption is correct, he continued, ""the answer is  not to increase sentences. The answer is to stop crime before it happens."" 
 But how? Prevention programs have had deep budget cuts, and there is disagreement on their effectiveness. The same for rehabilitation; up to 86 percent of those who served sentences in Youth Division detention centers are rearrested. And there is no proof that alternative programs for youths are more  successful than incarceration. 
 The grim picture argues for more fundamental change than the Governor has proposed -- revamping the juvenile-justice laws to address fundamental flaws. In 1978, in another tough-on-crime era, the Legislature mandated that all 13- 14- and 15-year-olds accused of serious crimes have their cases handled in adult courts; the system treats young offenders accused of serious crimes the same now, making it impossible for judges to exercise discretion and separate the more violent from those who might be redeemable. 
 Youth workers say that despite the depressing statistics, young criminals can sometimes be turned around. But if some of today's 5-year-olds are already being labeled tomorrow's ""superpredators,"" how likely is it that policy will be any more benign than the rhetoric?"
"229","Bronchitis Stops Tyson: Seldon Fight Is Off",862288,"|sports",4,7,1996,"19960704T000000",NA," 
 Mike Tyson is suffering from bronchitis, and his July 13 fight against Bruce  Seldon for Seldon's World Boxing Association heavyweight title has been postponed to eptember or October. 
 The surprise announcement came at a news conference yesterday in Las Vegas, Nev., involving the promoter Don King, the co-manager John Horne and Dr. Robert Voy, who has been treating Tyson. On Monday, Tyson said in a teleconference that he was healthy and looking forward to the fight. 
 King said Voy made the decision to postpone the bout. Voy, once the chief medical officer of the United States Olympic Committee, is a sports medicine specialist from Las Vegas and has treated Tyson before. 
 ""He hasn't had a full day's workout in the last two or three weeks,"" Voy said. ""He's been treated daily with antibiotics under the supervision of a lung  specialist. His progress has been very slow. He is recovering, but not quick enough. I don't think he would be ready for a heavyweight championship bout."" 
 Showtime Entertainment Television, which had been scheduled to show the fight on pay-per-view, will show the rescheduled fight. Jay Larkin, senior vice president of Showtime, the network's parent group, said the postponement was a ""disappointment."" 
 ""Everything was geared up,"" he said. ""The monetary loss we're looking at is in fees for production and marketing already done. But our commercials are already done and just have to be amended for another date."" 
 King said about 8,000 to 9,000 tickets had been sold for the fight at the MGM Grand, which seats 16,000. The postponement was the second for Tyson since his release from prison in March 1995. He was to have fought Buster Mathis Jr. last  November, but the fight was delayed six weeks after Tyson broke a thumb the week before the fight. Since his return, the 29-year-old Tyson has knocked out Tom McNeeley last Aug. 19 in 89 seconds, Mathis on Dec. 16 in three rounds and Frank Bruno of England March 16 in three rounds. The complexities of boxing politics and alphabet-soup governing bodies (W.B.C., W.B.A., I.B.F., W.B.O. and W.B.U.) had led Tyson and King to a seemingly strange course. 
 The World Boxing Council wants Tyson to defend against Lennox Lewis of England, a former champion and now its No. 1 contender. Lewis turned down a $13.5 million guarantee to fight Tyson. Lewis then accepted $4 million from King to step aside and allow Tyson to fight Seldon, with the proviso that Tyson, assuming he beat Seldon, would fight Lewis next. Tyson is expected to receive $30 million for fighting Seldon. 
 Now Lewis's handlers say they will guarantee Tyson $45 million to fight Lewis, but Tyson seems more interested in fighting Evander Holyfield, a former champion. If Tyson bypasses Lewis, the W.B.C. will strip Tyson of his title for  refusing to fight its top-ranked contender. It would then match Lewis and Oliver McCall, its second-ranked contender, for the vacant title. If all those things happened, the next big fight would probably be the Lewis-McCall winner against -- who else? -- Tyson. 
 And Riddick Bowe, another former champion, wants to get into the picture. Bowe fights Andrew Golota next Thursday night at Madison Square Garden, but he said his main targets were fights with Lewis or Tyson or both. 
 ""I believe they called off the Tyson fight because of money,"" Bowe said on a  hastily arranged conference call. ""I don't think tickets were selling that good. If they want to make money, I'm the guy to fight. I'm available."" 
 When Tyson was asked Monday what Seldon should be thinking, he said, ""Don't show up."" Now Tyson is the one not showing up.

"230","Moscow Journal;A Parade, Unofficial but Always on Time",862349,"|u.s.",4,7,1996,"19960704T000000","|MOSCOW (VERMONT)|MOSCOW, RUSSIA"," 
 The Presidential voting in Moscow, Russia, was a certainty. But the Independence Day celebration in Moscow, Vt., is traditionally up in the air. 
 People have been calling the Moscow General Store to find out whether there will be a parade on the Fourth of July. 
 Alexander LeVeille, who owns the store with his wife, Sarah, has been noncommittal. ""You never know until that day,"" he said on Tuesday. 
 The 200 residents of this hamlet hidden in the Green Mountains, just south of Stowe, pride themselves on their spontaneity. They wake up on July 4th and if the spirit moves them, they slap together a few floats, assemble on Tom Hamilton's front lawn around 10 A.M., march the 150 yards or so down Main Street, turn around, march back, and then disperse. For 19 straight years, the parade has just sort of happened. 
 ""There are no meetings, no planning,"" Mr. LeVeille said. The unofficial rules forbid it. No one is supposed to work on a float until the morning of the Fourth of July. 
 And, Mr. LeVeille, who wrapped his backhoe in red, white and blue crepe paper and drove it in last year's parade, said, ""You do not spend more than $50 on a float."" There is no winning float, of course. 
 Politicians are not invited. There is no grand marshal and no marching band.  The people of Moscow tune their radios to WDEV, out of Waterbury, and every year, on the assumption that the parade will go on, the station broadcasts about 30 minutes of marching music, starting at 10 A.M. 
 Still, after 19 parades it is hard to be entirely spontaneous. On Tuesday evening, Moscow's fabled All Ladies Lawn Chair Drill Team got together at Jane Christopherson's house to drink wine and -- in flagrant violation of the rules -- practice a few moves across the lawn. ""We are in deep trouble,"" Jan Kilburn said. 
 The 13 women, some of whom are in their 60's, were decked out in last year's  parade uniforms -- Hawaiian shirts, shorts, baseball caps and sunglasses. Ms. Christopherson, a onetime co-captain of the Burlington High School majorettes, had on her gold-lame Wiggins Co-op Inc. cap. 
 The women assembled in haphazard rows with their aluminum and plastic webbed  folding chairs -- except for Rudi Hamilton, who carried her folding-made-in-Vermont-wooden chair, as she does every year. On the count of eight, the women twirled the chairs around their waists, raised them above their heads, opened and shut them several times -- clack, clack, clack -- and sat on the chairs with their legs crossed for eight beats. 
 ""We've got it down this year,"" Ms. Christopherson said. 
 They repeated the routine several times. Mike Sheehy, who is a member of the  Moscow All-Men's Radio Marching Band, took pictures. As far as anyone knows, the men's marching band has never once practiced. 
 The women's practice lasted all of 10 minutes. The women hung around for a while, reminiscing about how the parade began. ""The first year there were 25 people,"" said Mrs. Hamilton, who, with her husband, Ed, helped organize it. 
 ""There were no spectators,"" Nancy Stead said. 
 Last year more than 1,000 people from surrounding communities showed up. 
 The Moscow parade goes with laid-back Vermont. Since there are no police officers to block off the street, traffic can be a problem. Anyone who happens to drive down Main Street between 10 and 10:30 that morning ends up in the parade. 
 Two years ago the women's lawn chair drill team was invited to march in nearby Morrisville's parade, an hour later than Moscow's. They all piled in Jane Christopherson's van for the trip, but when they got there, they decided not to  march. 
 ""It looked like it was going to be miles and miles,"" Barbara Williams said. 
 Anne Lusk was on her porch Tuesday afternoon, fashioning a badminton net into the ""Moscow Internet"" for her float. Yes, she was cheating. Ms. Lusk, who marched as a Holstein cow last year, cheats every year by starting on her float  two days early. 
 At the general store, Mr. LeVeille and his wife said they were thinking of building a float for 79-year-old Evelyn Ayers, who sorts the mail at the post office, which is in the general store. 
 ""She's going to be queen of the parade,"" Mrs. LeVeille said. 
 But the LeVeilles have not breathed a word of their plan to Mrs. Ayers, who usually is a spectator at the parade. And on Tuesday, Mrs. Ayers was busy packing. After 79 years in Moscow, she is planning to move to Craftsbury, 25 miles north, to live with her daughter. 
 Is she planning to go to the parade? ""If I don't forget,"" she said."
"231","Antarctic Ice Core May Help Predict Start of Next Ice Age",863312,"|science|health",9,7,1996,"19960709T000000","|ANTARCTIC REGIONS|ANTARCTIC REGIONS"," 
 ICE that has lain undisturbed for hundreds of thousands of years is yielding  clues that may foreshadow our own future when Earth's present warming trend gives way to a new era of glaciation and cold. 
 During the Southern Hemisphere summer, which concluded three months ago, scientists from Russia, France and the United States drilled deeply into the South Polar ice sheet at Russia's Vostok Station, recovering ice that formed some 400,000 years ago. The precious core samples of ice brought up from the depths, cylindrical samples totaling nearly two miles in length, include the oldest ice scientists have ever been able to analyze. 
 In recent years, two major drilling projects in Greenland have retrieved ice at great depths, but because snowfall in Antarctica, about an inch a year, is only one-tenth as heavy as snowfall in Greenland, a given depth of compacted snow in Antarctica represents an age 10 times as great as it would in Greenland. 
 Dr. Todd Sowers, a Pennsylvania State University paleoclimatologist studying  ice core samples that have just arrived from Vostok, said that the hole had penetrated layers of ice that go back in time through at least three and perhaps four complete cycles of global glaciation. Glaciologists disagree as to how long a typical period of glaciation lasts, but many believe that it averages about 100,000 years. 
 ""The longest continuous climate record we've got from ice cores drilled in Greenland is 110,000 years,"" he said. ""That didn't even get us back into the last interglacial period. The Vostok hole in Antarctica went on to penetrate an  additional 150,000 years, taking us through the last interglacial period, the ice age that preceded it and on into the next interglacial period. During the past summer, we went deeper still, at least doubling the climate record and perhaps quadrupling it, for at least three climate cycles."" 
 Glaciologists have not yet had time to determine the chronology of cold and warm periods represented by the latest Vostok samples, Dr. Sowers said, but they hope to present some detailed results at a meeting in England in August. One more season of drilling, beginning in the Antarctic spring next October, Dr. Sowers said, should complete the hole and allow the team to cut through ice sediments to a depth representing 500,000 years in the past -- a span encompassing at least three periods of global glaciation. 
 Interglacial periods, particularly the parts of them punctuated by rapid changes in climate, interest climatologists because of the light they may shed on the present-day interglacial period. Several research projects focus on an interglacial period called the Younger Dryas, from 16,000 to 10,000 years ago. Global climate conditions then were unstable, returning much of Earth to near-glacial conditions. 
 Global warming in our own day could stimulate climate instabilities leading to a similar return to global chilling and the growth of ice sheets, some scientists believe. 
 The hole at Vostok could be drilled even deeper, but Russian radar crews have identified a lake of liquid water, about the size of Lake Ontario, resting on bedrock beneath more than two miles of ice under Vostok Station. The water in the lake, kept liquid by geological heat and pressure, has probably been trapped for more than half a million years. 
 Tapping the lake with the present drill rig would contaminate it badly with drilling oil and other substances, which could damage any living organisms there. The international body that supervises all Antarctic research that might  affect the continent's environment -- the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research, known as SCAR -- is unlikely to approve any project that would contaminate the lake. The committee is expected to discuss the possibilities at  a meeting in August at Cambridge University in England. 
 To sample ice, scientists use tubular drills that cut cylindrical ice cores as they descend. The drills are lubricated by diesel oil. A typical ice core sample is about 30 feet long, and many of the cores retrieved from Vostok and other holes are kept frozen at the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver, to which they are transported by freezer vans. 
 The exact dimensions of Vostok's subglacial lake have been revealed by radar, and the Vostok drilling equipment will get no closer than about 150 feet to the  top of the liquid water. But even without going deeper, scientists expect a bonanza of information from the deep ice. The deeper they drill, the greater is  the span of time represented by each foot of depth because of the compression of the layers under two miles of ice. 
 The hope is that samples from Vostok and other Antarctic sites, combined with analyses of ice cores from two completed drilling projects on the Greenland Ice  Sheet, will enable scientists to piece together the atmospheric, marine and continental chronology and mechanisms leading to global climate changes, including those that might cast a new mantle of ice over much of the world's temperate zones within the next century or so. 
 Despite the immense stretches of geological time represented by ice ages, there is growing evidence that abrupt, short-term climate changes leading to worldwide flooding or glaciation have been fairly common in the past and that people alive today might experience such a change in their own lifetimes. Such an interval might last only a few hundred years, like the ""Little Ice Age"" that  chilled Europe beginning around 1400, but its social effects might be severe. 
 In a paper published last month by the journal Nature, Dr. Paul A. Mayewski of the University of New Hampshire, in Durham, and colleagues at the Desert Research Institute, in Reno, and the Universities of New Hampshire, Washington and Miami, presented new evidence that global climate changes could occur abruptly. 
 Two years ago, Dr. Michael Bender of the University of Rhode Island and his colleagues reported that an analysis of oxygen isotopes in Greenland ice samples suggested that climate change had sometimes been abrupt, at least in the Northern Hemisphere. But ice samples from Vostok in Antarctica showed no such rapid variations, they found. 
 The new investigation by Dr. Mayewski's team focused not on Vostok, but on a  coastal Antarctic site similar to the one in Greenland tapped by the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2. 
 Dr. Mayewski's team investigated core samples from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet at Taylor Dome, near the Ross Sea. An analysis showed that during a critical period of deglaciation between 10,000 and 16,000 years ago, the climate in the Southern Hemisphere was apparently just as abruptly variable as it was in Greenland. 
 Change can come swiftly and with devastating results, particularly if a warming trend causes the collapse of a major ice sheet and raises the global sea level. 
 Dr. Mayewski said in an interview that the onset of certain cold periods, not long-term ice ages, but relatively short periods within longer periods of general warming, has occurred in less than 20 years in both Greenland and Antarctica. This suggests that such changes can be global in extent. 
 Scientists trying to predict Earth's future climate look to the past for clues embedded in ancient ice, sea and land sediments, tree rings, fossil rats'  nests and many other sources. But paleoclimatologists face problems in meshing the data they collect from different sources. 
 One goal of current research is to determine the ""phasing"" of climatic change in the Arctic and Antarctic. When related climate events occur at different times in different places, inferences can be drawn as to causes and effects, and how changes propagate around the world. When certain climate changes are seen to occur at about the same time in widely separated places, ""the possibilities would include something external to the Earth,"" Dr. Mayewski said. That would support the theory that short-term changes in the output of the sun influence Earth's climate, he said. 
 Among the indicators that paleoclimatologists measure are the ratios of two forms of oxygen: oxygen-16 and oxygen-18. It is believed that a high ratio of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 in molecules of frozen water reflects a relatively high atmospheric temperature at the time the ice formed. 
 Scientists also look for ""greenhouse"" gases, especially carbon dioxide and methane; such gases absorb solar radiation but block the loss of heat by the atmosphere. 
 Two important indicators of ancient wind-circulation patterns are calcium and sodium. The calcium in ice cores comes almost entirely from air that has passed  over continental land masses, while sodium comes almost exclusively from air mixed with sea spray. Other ions (electrically charged atoms or molecules) also  help scientists reconstruct atmospheric circulation patterns. 
 Scientists are also measuring the pressure of trapped air within ice bubbles. By combining this information with temperature estimates, they believe, they can use the bubbles as miniature altimeters to gauge the height above sea level of the ice sheet at various times in the past. 
 Dr. Mayewski notes that the most recent rapid-change event, the onset of the  so-called Little Ice Age, occurred about A.D. 1400. That event ended between 1850 and 1900, but the circulation patterns it initiated may still be in effect, he believes. 
 ""The Little Ice Age may still be going on,"" Dr. Mayewski said, ""although it goes through ups and downs. It may last for another few hundred years."" 
 To the extent that human activity may tend to warm Earth's atmosphere, Dr. Mayewski believes, the warming could conflict with natural circulation patterns  induced by the Little Ice Age cooling. The result could be a greater number of violent storms and an increasing frequency of El Nino oscillations -- the periodic appearance of a vast pool of warm water in the Pacific Ocean, which strongly influences climate. 
 ""Evidence accumulated during the last few years suggests that this is actually happening,"" Dr. Mayewski said. ""When I started doing research in Antarctica in the 1960's, we assumed that the Antarctic Ice Sheet was a giant sluggish beast that dominated its own climate, rather than being influenced by short-term changes in global climate. Now we're seeing that at least the edges of the ice sheet are much more sensitive to climate change than we knew. 
 ""The ice is telling us that climate can radically change within the span of a single human life. That's something to think about."""
"232","Despite Brawl After a Match, Bouts Will Stay at the Garden",864237,"|new york|region",13,7,1996,"19960713T000000","|NEW YORK CITY"," 
 A day after a bone-crushing brawl between rival retinues and angry fans who began landing blows once the professional fighters had been stopped, Madison Square Garden officials said yesterday that they would continue staging boxing matches. 
 The fray followed a prizefight between Riddick Bowe and Andrew Golota. It raised questions about whether the Garden -- where boxing legends like Muhammad  Ali, Joe Frazier, Sugar Ray Robinson and Jake LaMotta fought their way to fame -- had warned the police of the potential for violence among fans. Authorities also wondered whether the police, who subdued the brawl after a 911 call from a  man watching it on cable television at home in Brooklyn, had mobilized fast enough. 
 This was not handled as well as I'd like to see this handled,"" Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, said. 
 But he added that the Garden -- which got back into the fight business last year after staging matches only sporadically in the 1980's and not at all since  1993 -- would go ahead with the next scheduled one, on Aug. 13. Boxing has proved a big moneymaker for owners worried that the Garden has been dark too often. 
 Eleven people were arrested yesterday in connection with the incident, which  sent a dozen people to the hospital with minor injuries. The police say they expect to make more arrests. 
 The fray began when the referee gave Thursday night's heavyweight bout to Mr. Bowe, the 252-pound former champion, disqualifying Mr. Golota for landing low blows. Mr. Bowe's manager, Rock Newman, jumped into the ring, where the fighter  was lying on the canvas. 
 Soon, someone was pounding Mr. Golota's head with a walkie-talkie. And fans waving Polish flags, who had come to root for the Warsaw-born Mr. Golota, were climbing into the ring. 
 The battle continued for several minutes before the two sides were subdued. Most of Mr. Bowe's fans were black and most of Mr. Golota's white, but the police said they did not believe that racial antagonism had precipitated the fighting. 
 The police said yesterday that they had filed charges against three men in Mr. Bowe's camp. Police Commissioner Howard Safir identified the man who had hit Mr. Golota on the head with the walkie-talkie as Jason Harris, a member of Mr. Bowe's entourage. Mr. Harris gave himself up last night, the police said. He was charged with assault and, for wielding the radio, criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree. 
 Detectives from the Midtown South precinct arrested at least two other members of Mr. Bowe's entourage yesterday. Stephen Bowe, 23, whom the police identified as Mr.  Bowe's brother, was charged with assault for throwing punches in the ring. William Wright, 31, was also arrested, and charged with assault and inciting to riot. Mr. Safir said Mr. Wright was ""part of the Bowe group."" 
 As of last night eight other people had been arrested in connection with the  brawl. The police identified them as: Joe Gregory, 29; Yohance Maqubela, 22; Gkzegorz Glowack, 20; Darius Konefal, 28; Andrew Holyaski, 20; Andrzes Walat, 20; Melvin Foster, 43, and Steven Wright, 16. 
 The police said they had learned of the fight about 10:45, when spectators scurrying out of the Garden told some of the 16 officers on crowd-control duty outside that fans were fighting. That was roughly six minutes after the seventh-round disqualification and six minutes after the chairs, beer cans and punches started flying. 
 Police supervisors ordered the officers at the Garden to report to 32d Street and Seventh Avenue, where they gathered in a wedge-shaped formation, ready to move in and restore order, Mr. Safir said. ""We were there in seconds,"" he added. 
 But they did not go in immediately because, under a protocol revised after a  stampede at a City College basketball game several years ago, the police are supposed to wait for a security liaison from inside the building to invite them  in. 
 Mr. Safir and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said the invitation never came. 
 One person in the crowd who tried to summon help was Randy Levine, the city's former Labor Commissioner and now the chief negotiator for Major League Baseball. Mr. Levine said he had called the police desk at City Hall within four minutes of the disqualification. 
 Then he called the Mayor, who was doing an interview at WPIX-TV. He said Mr.  Giuliani already knew about the tumult. The Mayor soon left the station and went to the Garden, where he was ushered into one of the dressing rooms under heavy guard. 
 At 10:48, the 911 system received its first call about the melee, from a man  on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn who said he was watching it on HBO, the cable network that had broadcast the bout. ""About 100 people are fighting in the ring,"" the man said. 
 A minute later, 911 sent out a call for a mobilization and assigned all officers in the Midtown South sector to respond to the Garden. At the same time, a call of ""officer in need of assistance"" went out over the police radio, and the police went in. 
 Between 2,000 and 3,000 fans were still inside. The police report on the incident revealed that besides the pummeling going on in the ring, there were ""several groups of fighting males in the crowd."" Officers cordoned off the apron surrounding the ring and began breaking up the brawls. A total of 150 officers were on hand by 11:08, when the police declared the situation under control. 
 Reviewing the incident yesterday, the Mayor said that Madison Square Garden should have notified the Police Department of the potential for violence in a crowd that was younger and more aggressive than the Knicks, Rangers or Ice Capades crowds that often fill the same seats. 
 ""You can't expect the Police Department to be omnipresent and able to predict every single thing that would happen,"" the Mayor said. ""They have to rely on the sports organization to come to them to ask for additional help."" 
 The Mayor said that he had already talked with Garden officials about changing the policy to increase the police presence at sporting events. 
 ""From now on,"" he said, ""we have to have more access, we have to have, the police have, the right to and the opportunity to be inside these arenas, not at  the request of anyone."" 
 Some spectators said the wait for the police had seemed frighteningly long. 
 ""If indeed the police were there when they say,"" said Anthony D. Weiner, a City Councilman from Brooklyn, ""they were nowhere near the action."" Mr. Weiner,  who was attending his first prizefight and was accompanied by his father, added: 
 ""We waited, I'd say, a good 10 to 12 minutes, expecting the police to swoop down and stop this thing. The announcer said, more than once, 'If there are any  New York City police officers, come to ringside.' First, it was security personnel to ringside. Then, at least twice, he said, 'New York City police officers report to ringside.' "" 
 A Garden vice president, John Cirillo, defended the Garden's 70 security officers and 50 ushers. ""They were prepared and they acted accordingly,"" he said. ""It was an unfortunate situation. We are going to make sure we take every  precaution to do a better job in the future."" 
 He said that Garden officials would meet with the Mayor and Mr. Safir next week ""to discuss making the Garden as safe a facility as we can."" 
 Correction:  July 15, 1996, Monday 
 A front-page article on Saturday about a brawl after a boxing match at Madison Square Garden Thursday night referred incorrectly to Stephen Bowe, one of the men arrested. He is a nephew of the boxer Riddick Bowe, not his brother.  He attended the bout as a spectator, not as a member of the boxer's ring entourage."

 Several thousand Serbs demonstrated today in the last Serbian-held enclave in Croatia, demanding a delay in a scheduled transition to Croatian rule. 
 The enclave, Eastern Slavonia, is to come under Croatian authority by January 1997, but the Serbian protesters appealed for the United Nations Security Council to extend the transition for another year. 
 Their list of demands included calls for civil-rights guarantees for Serbs and for political and economic autonomy from the Croatian Government in Zagreb. 
 Diplomats have said that Serbian demands for autonomy are unrealistic since the former warring parties agreed to give Croatia control of the area, which falls within its recognized borders. 
 The rally today was held in the eastern town of Vukovar, the scene of some of the Yugoslav conflict's worst destruction. Serbian fighters backed by the Yugoslav Army pounded Vukovar with artillery until it fell in November 1991, then expelled non-Serbs from the area."
"234","Japan Is to Use an Old Law To Combat Food Poisoning",868841,"|world",1,8,1996,"19960801T000000","|Japan"," 
 Stepping up its fight against serious outbreaks of food poisoning, Japan's Health and Welfare Ministry decided today to invoke a century-old law that gives the Government emergency powers to set up quarantines and take other stringent steps to fight epidemics. 
 Government officials stressed that they had no intention of isolating people who have been infected with the bacterium, E. coli O157:H7, which causes bloody diarrhea and can lead to kidney failure and death. 
 However, by designating the bacterial infection as a serious communicable disease under the anti-epidemic law, the Government will be able to compel people deemed to be at risk to be tested for infection. The Government will also be able to disinfect homes and workplaces and to require people who are infected to stay away from certain jobs, like food preparation. 
 Nearly 9,000 people have been infected since May and 7 have died, according to Government figures. The cases have occurred throughout Japan, though the most serious outbreak was in Sakai, a city near Osaka where more than 6,000 elementary school children were sickened, presumably by contaminated school lunches. But even as they announced the sterner measures, some health officials were hopeful that the outbreaks are subsiding. 
 ''I think we will soon have passed the peak,'' Tomohisa Shimoda, director of the health sciences division at the Ministry of Health and Welfare, said in an interview today. He warned, though, that the situation must continue to be watched closely. 
 The number of new cases is climbing slowly now. The number of people hospitalized nationwide has dropped to 440, from a peak of 595 on Saturday. In Sakai, the number of elementary school children in serious condition has dropped to 17, from more than 90 a week ago. 
 One lingering concern is that people who are infected can infect others. In addition, Sakai officials, by offering free tests, have found more than 284 people who are infected but show few or no symptoms, suggesting that there might be healthy carriers of the infection. 
 The national Government and some local governments, such as in Sakai, have been criticized by citizens for not reacting quickly enough when the first food-poisoning cases were reported, and the Government is now becoming more aggressive. 
 Still, there were concerns raised today that the invoking of the 1897  law, intended to battle epidemics like cholera and dysentery, would lead to discrimination against infected people and abuse of their rights. 
 ''The law doesn't take much account of human rights and is concerned only with prevention,'' Health and Welfare Minister Naoto Kan was quoted as saying by Kyodo News Service. ''We must be very careful in applying the law.'' The official invoking of the law is expected as early as next week. 
 The bacterium, first recognized as a pathogen in the United States in 1982, lives in the intestines of cattle. Many infections are caused by under-cooked ground beef. 
 Japanese officials have been unable to find the source of most of the outbreaks, including the one in Sakai. But today, officials reported some clues from analysis of the genetic makeup of the bacteria. Officials said the bacteria involved in outbreaks in seven prefectures, mainly in western Japan, were genetically similar, suggesting there might be a common cause to those outbreaks. But the bacteria found in Sakai were different, suggesting a different source. There were also bacteria found that seemed genetically different from the other two groups. 
 Experts on the bacterial infection from the United States Government conferred today in Tokyo with Japanese authorities. The American officials had come to Kyoto over the weekend for a previously scheduled international conference. 
 Dr. Stephen M. Ostroph, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told the Japanese experts that there were no ''magic bullets'' for treating the infections and noted that food products are distributed widely, so that contamination can affect a lot of people quickly. ''This is the future of food-borne disease,'' he said."
"235","California Governor Cuts Off Aid for Illegal Immigrants",873967,"|front page|u.s.",28,8,1996,"19960828T000000","|California|United States"," 
 Moving aggressively under the new Federal welfare law to cut off state services to illegal immigrants, Gov. Pete Wilson today signed an executive order ending those immigrants' access to benefits ranging from public housing to prenatal care and child abuse prevention programs. 
 State officials said the Federal legislation, which President Clinton signed into law last Thursday, had won them a partial but important triumph in their struggle to enforce the provisions of Proposition 187. That ballot initiative, denying state services to people who enter the United States illegally, was approved  overwhelmingly by California voters in 1994 but has been enjoined by court order since then. 
 Neither the new Federal welfare act nor the Governor's order, the first of its kind in the nation to result from the law, bars illegal immigrants from public primary or secondary schools, as the ballot initiative was supposed to. Nor does it keep them from emergency health care. 
 But officials said the new restrictions would cover hundreds of other state services and programs, including many, like the issuance of licenses, that were not contemplated under the initiative. 
 ''Today's executive order, I think, is a vindication, as is the act itself,'' Mr. Wilson said in a signing ceremony at the State Capitol in Sacramento. Both steps, he said, answer Californians' demand ''that the Federal Government end the magnetic lure of public services and benefits that have substantially spawned our national crisis of illegal immigration.'' 
 But like Proposition 187, the Governor's order was immediately met by the threat of challenges in the courts. 
 Civil rights advocates argued that the state government had jumped the gun by failing to wait for regulations that, under the new Federal statute, the Justice Department must issue within the next 18 months on how the immigration status of people applying for services should be verified. Mr. Wilson, these opponents said, has in effect usurped Federal jurisdiction over the country's immigration laws by authorizing almost any state employee to begin asking the people they serve whether they entered the United States legally. 
 ''If they try to implement any part of this tomorrow, we will be in court at 12:01,'' said Mark Rosenbaum, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, one of the lawyers who won a Federal injunction against Proposition 187 last November. 
 Opponents of the Governor's order maintained that it would promote discrimination against anyone who might appear to be an immigrant to  inquiring state employees. And, they said by restricting access to primary health care it would send illegal immigrants flooding into hospital emergency rooms, thus raising taxpayers' health costs rather than reducing them, and might ultimately pose a public health emergency. 
 Mr. Wilson, an ardent supporter of Proposition 187, has led a small but influential group of governors in demanding both Federal compensation for the cost incurred by states in helping illegal immigrants and the right to cut off services to them. 
 In issuing his order today, he acted under a provision of the new Federal law that makes illegal immigrants ineligible for all state and Federal benefits except a few specific services like emergency medical care, immunization programs and emergency disaster relief. The Federal law allows the states to extend assistance to illegal immigrants only by enacting a new state law ''which affirmatively provides for such eligibility.'' 
 The Governor's order does not affect legal immigrants, Most of them are to lose their eligibility for food stamps, disability assistance and other benefits under the new law. In addition, the law gives states the option to cut off Medicaid to most legal immigrants, and Mr. Wilson said before its passage that he supported that provision. 
 As for illegal immigrants, they are already barred from access to most benefit programs, including cash assistance, food stamps and nonemergency Medicaid care. 
 Mr. Wilson's order goes much further. Although state officials said today that they did not yet have a full listing of the programs affected or how much money the new restrictions might save, the Governor's chief spokesman, Sean T. Walsh, said the order would bar illegal immigrants from long-term health care and all professional and commercial licenses. In addition, it would bar them from admission to state colleges and universities unless they  paid the full cost of their education. 
 One other set of state programs covered is prenatal care, run by the state's Health and Welfare Agency. A spokeswoman there, Lisa Kalustian, said the prenatal care programs alone served more than 70,000 illegal immigrants a year, at a cost of $69.3 million. 
 Mr. Walsh said that under the Governor's order, some of the assistance now available to illegal immigrants ''could be cut off tomorrow, or within a week.'' He said it was more realistic, however, to expect any cutoff to become effective within 30 to 60 days. 
 Some immigrants-rights advocates said they agreed that most of the restrictions expected to result from Mr. Wilson's order would eventually be allowed under the Federal legislation in any case. 
 ''The welfare bill does explicitly give the states the right to do almost anything they want on this, and Wilson is doing it in a very political way,'' said Cecilia Munoz, an official of the National Council of La Raza, an umbrella organization of Hispanic  groups. But she cautioned that the move would carry high costs, in more than one way. 
 ''These kinds of things cost much more to implement than they save,'' Ms. Munoz said. ''And anybody with the wrong last name is immediately suspect. If somebody like me applies for a cosmetology license, I could be denied access to things I have a right to, because of my ethnicity. And I am a U.S. citizen.'' 
 Lawyers involved in the battle to keep Proposition 187 from taking effect said they believed that the injunction against it, issued last year by a Federal district judge, Mariana R. Pfaelzer, would at least hinder implementation of those parts of the new welfare law dealing with illegal immigrants. The lawyers noted that  the injunction specifically barred state employees from asking the immigration status of people they suspect of having entered the country illegally. 
 The welfare law stipulates that the Attorney General will issue regulations within 18 months about how Government agencies may screen applicants for Federal benefits, and that states should issue their own, complementary rules within 24 months after that. 
 ''In order to deny anybody anything, you have to make a determination about someone's legal status, and under the welfare bill there is an elaborate process set up for the development of a reliable verification process by Federal personnel,'' Mr. Rosenbaum said. ''The cornerstone of the 187 injunction is that state personnel cannot act as immigration agents.''"

 Sojourner Truth  A Life, a Symbol.  By Nell Irvin Painter.  Illustrated. 370 pp. New York:  W. W. Norton & Company. $28. 
 Sojourner Truth strides through American history larger than life. Tall, husky-voiced, stern-visaged and midnight black, she peers out at us from popular etchings and photographs as the very embodiment of the Strong Black Woman. Her most famous utterance -- ''Ar'n't I a woman?'' -- defines the contested terrain between the races and the sexes and demands that we consider the special place of black women in our racially divided, sex-segregated past. 
 If Sojourner Truth seems somewhat larger than life, it is because she was. Like her name, taken to replace the rather ill-fitting Isabella Van Wagenen, her persona was carefully constructed by herself; this shrewd, illiterate former slave understood that her life was her only capital. But self-invention, so characteristic of the 19th century, was only one dimension of Sojourner Truth's story. Others also saw value in her person and joined in the construction of Sojourner Truth, sometimes without invitation, often with her silent consent. The result was part shameless self-promotion, part astute politics and part idealistic wish fulfillment. The job of disentangling these convoluted layers of identity is taken up by Nell Irvin Painter, Edwards Professor of History at Princeton University, in her sweeping biography ''Sojourner Truth: A Life, a Symbol.'' As Ms. Painter makes clear, nothing is simple about Sojourner Truth, from her birth in the late 18th century to her death nearly 90 years later. Although she came to represent the horrors of Southern slavery, Truth endured her captivity just north of New York City, in a so-called free state where chattel bondage lasted well into the third decade of the 19th century. While she presented herself as a straight-talking, no-nonsense independent black woman, Truth leaned on white patrons throughout her life. She challenged them cautiously, careful not to break ties that might yield some advantage. Even after she fled a physically abusive owner and his sexually abusive wife, she remained on good terms with them and their family, fulfilling one of the oldest proslavery stereotypes by returning to care for her dying mistress. 
 Moreover, while Truth gloried in representing the disadvantaged -- ''the niggers of de South and de women at de Norf,'' as her words were transcribed in 1861 -- her closest associates were middle-class white people, and her formative experiences were in institutions directed by white men and women. Her early religious life took shape not within the walls of the African-American church but first in a stiff-backed Dutch Reformed congregation, then among perfectionist Methodist evangelicals and, perhaps most prominently, in a fringe, even lunatic cult led by one Prophet Matthias. 
 Her friendships also tacked toward the white rather than the black community. In the 1830's, during her residence in New York City, it was not the nascent black community of Peter Williams Sr., Samuel Cornish or Henry Highland Garnet who formed her social circle, but the weird assortment of middle-class millennialists of Matthias's cult. When she left New York for the Berkshires and the Northampton Association for Education and Industry in Massachusetts, a radical commune of socialist leanings, the white Garrisonian George W. Benson, not David Ruggles, the black conductor of the Underground Railroad, became her confidant. 
 Sojourner Truth found advantages in communities of dissent, but the unorthodox religious and secular institutions to which she lent her voice and her muscle rarely accorded her more than second-class citizenship. While the Prophet Matthias's followers awaited the demise of this world and the birth of another, she cleaned up after the prophet and his serial lovers, accepting his blows and their sexual abuse much as she had taken the lash of her former owners. In the Northampton Association, she was assigned to the laundry room, a painful playing out of yet another all too common stereotype. 
 ''The Narrative of Sojourner Truth'' (1850), ghostwritten by Olive Gilbert, an unsympathetic amanuensis, reflected unfavorably on her children and her record as a mother. But she hawked it enthusiastically, and it became her most dependable source of income. Similarly, the best-known formulation of Truth's historic query respecting the place of black women in the woman's rights movement came not from her lips but from the pen of the white reformer Frances Gage, who improved on Truth's remarks at the 1851 Woman's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio, for her own polemical purposes. Truth never contradicted Gage's rendering. 
 The picture that emerges from this forthright biography is hardly that of an uncompromised standard-bearer of black womanhood. But as Ms. Painter points out, Sojourner Truth was no patsy. When she was needed, she was there for herself, her family and her people. The great strength of Ms. Painter's biography is its understanding of how Isabella slowly, if incompletely, sloughed off the weight of slavery, mastered herself and employed the camouflage of race -- native wit rather than book learning, quaint dialect rather than fine elocution, ramrod posture rather than feminine demeanor, severe dress rather than fashionable attire -- to make herself a symbol of black womanhood of a certain sort. As she did so she found that she had numerous co-conspirators: women, both black and white, who wanted to insert ''blackness into feminism and gender into racial identity.'' Her critical interjection -- ''Ar'n't I a woman?'' -- at the Woman's Rights Convention elevated Sojourner Truth to her historic role. But was it the real Sojourner Truth? 
 Perhaps. After sorting through a thin historical record, in which her spoken words are always mediated through the pens of others, Ms. Painter concludes that it is impossible to know, but possibly the symbolic Sojourner Truth had swallowed up the real one. She bends her efforts to tracing the process by which the two became one, and the one took on a life of her own. 
 Ms. Painter moves to firmer ground as she follows the development of the legend who now appears on T-shirts and lapel pins as she once appeared on photo prints and popular etchings, and whose words -- whose words? -- are quoted with authority by those in need of a feminist who is authentically black or a black woman who is authentically feminist.

"240","Sorenstam Putts to Victory Using a Blissful Approach",901513,"|sports",13,1,1997,"19970113T000000",NA," 
 Her marriage eight days earlier had given her a calm that she had never felt before. And being paired in today's final round of the Chrysler-Plymouth Tournament of Champions with last year's leading money-winner, Karrie Webb, was all the motivation that Annika Sorenstam needed. 
 ''I get really inspired playing with her,'' said Sorenstam, who entered today's round tied with Webb for the lead at 10 under par. ''She doesn't miss a lot of fairways or greens.'' 
 Webb, however, had trouble solving Weston Hills Country Club's 6,113-yard layout today, but Sorenstam, using a new putter, did not. Sorenstam dropped eight birdies, sandwiched around two bogeys, en route to a 66 that enabled her to finish at 16-under-par 272, four strokes better than Webb. 
 Sorenstam turned adversity into triumph. Five of her clubs were damaged last week in an airline baggage accident, including her putter. She switched to a putter with zero loft, which turned out to be ''perfect,'' she said, ''because the greens here are so fast.'' 
 Barb Mucha finished third, one stroke behind Webb after Webb birdied on the final hole. 
 As this shootout between Sorenstam and Webb unfolded today, never mind that Webb often outdrove Sorenstam by some 15 yards. Sorenstam's putter was more than the equalizer, especially on the back nine where, machine-like, she had four birdies. 
 Besides the eight birdies, Sorenstam's putts for birdie on Holes 6 and 7 lipped the cup. 
 ''I never putted this well,'' she said. ''All week I could see the line from when I walked up to the putt.'' 
 Webb said: ''She was just making them from everywhere. It just wasn't meant to be for me.'' 
 Sorenstam thought the turning point was the 12th hole. At that point, Webb trailed by only a stroke and had a 4-foot putt for a birdie, while Sorenstam was looking at a 12-foot shot to make birdie. 
 ''I imagine she felt pretty tired when I made that,'' Sorenstam said. ''I know I would be tired playing someone who makes every single putt.'' 
 The 26-year-old Swede was just getting warmed up. She made a 15-footer on No. 15, but by Webb's estimation, it was her 20-footer on No. 16 that settled this duel. 
 ''Going into the hole, I was thinking: 'I'm three down with three to go. I still have a chance,' '' Webb said. ''But when she made that long one, I said, 'That's it.' '' 
 Sorenstam said she wasn't even thinking birdie on that hole. 
 ''I was thinking I just wanted to try to get it close, and it went in,'' she said. 
 So it was a wonderfully memorable week for Sorenstam. Her marriage a week ago Saturday to David Esch certainly didn't hurt. 
 ''I think I'm walking on clouds right now,'' said Sorenstam, who won $115,000 and a new Chrysler Sebring convertible. ''I am so happy on the inside that I guess it helps me play better. I feel so relaxed.'' 
 Esch followed Sorenstam around the course, providing comfort wherever possible. After each hole, he would try to think of something positive to say. Over dinner Saturday night, Esch said to her: ''It's the first tournament of the year. Take it easy. You're doing great.'' 
 At the time, maybe even he didn't realize just how right he was.

 You have probably seen the TV commercial in which John Wayne finds his misplaced beer in an Army barracks. Unless you're one of the 17 Americans who did not watch the Super Bowl, you surely saw the commercial in which Fred Astaire danced up and down the walls wielding some sort of vacuum cleaner. 
 Were you amazed that these two dead movie stars could perform in brand new commercials despite being in a post-life condition? If so, sit back and hold on to your socks because, if I may vary the immortal words of Al Jolson, you ain't seen nothin' yet. 
 In fact you will soon see the late Al Jolson himself looking just as immortal as his immortal words. Al is starring in a new 30-second commercial for a corporation that sells eyeglasses. 
 The plot goes like this: Woman wearing specs comes into the sponsor's store. Says, ''Can't see a thing with these glasses.'' ''No wonder,'' says salesman, played by Al Jolson. ''Lenses are coated with greasy fingerprints, solid auto-exhaust emissions and dandruff. Let me wash them for you.'' 
 Putting on freshly cleaned specs, woman cries, ''I can see! I can see!'' Salesman Jolson, slipping set of sponsor's eyeglasses over her nose, says, ''You ain't seen nothin' yet!'' She reads bottom line of eye chart flawlessly and tells Jolson, ''I could kiss you if you weren't married to Greta Garbo -- or one of those old-time movie stars, y'know, whoever.'' 
 The eyeglasses people had to pay big money to outbid the hearing-aid industry for Jolson. In the hearing-aid commercial he would have said, ''You ain't heard nothin' yet.'' 
 Jolson's agent, the late Irving (Swifty) Lazar, insists that money was not the only factor in Al's choosing eyeglasses over hearing aids. ''You ain't heard nothin' yet'' is the real immortal line Al uttered in ''The Jazz Singer,'' and he wanted the challenge of doing fresh material. 
 ''Al hates to repeat himself,'' says the late Swifty. 
 Also in production is a controversial Kennedy-Nixon debate commercial for a beer conglomerate. Both late Presidents will be seen looking just as they did in the Presidential debates of 1960. 
 At present the script has them standing at lecterns and facing each other. Kennedy jabs his finger at Nixon and says, ''Tastes great!'' Nixon raises both hands, gives his V-for-victory salute and says, ''Less filling!'' 
 The camera then pulls back to the late Lyndon Johnson saying, ''Tastes great!'' Then to the late Dwight Eisenhower saying, ''Less filling!'' Then to Franklin Roosevelt: ''Tastes great!'' he says. Theodore Roosevelt chimes in: ''Less filling!'' 
 Getting this much deceased talent signed to do a commercial is not easy. Nixon, for example, refuses to do the commercial unless the ad agency drops its insistence that he wear the dark whiskers he wore in the 1960 debate with Kennedy. 
 It is suspected that Nixon already has a shaving-cream commercial in the can and fears the soap industry's attorney, the late Clarence Darrow, would sue him if he appeared on TV looking badly shaved. 
 One of the exciting projects is a commercial for a household smoke-alarm device starring Napoleon Bonaparte. It opens with a spectacular wide shot of Moscow burning. Then we see Napoleon face to face with the Czar. Napoleon says, ''If you'd bought a smoke alarm, this wouldn't have happened.'' 
 This project is still not in production. Two problems: 
 First, the Russian gangsters who own Moscow want more money than the smoke-alarm industry can afford without asking Napoleon to work free. They'd have to persuade him it would be worth a fortune in the long run to get name recognition in America. 
 Second, Napoleon refuses to speak his line in English. Industry rumors have it that the late General de Gaulle turned down the commercial rather than say it in English. And that Napoleon, being twice as great as de Gaulle, must also refuse to use the tongue of the Anglo-Saxons. 
 That's one story. Another is that Napoleon tried to learn the line in English, but gave it up in despair, telling the ad agency he was too dead to get his tongue around English vowels. 
 The biggest advertising story of the spring, however, will be about the carving-knife industry signing Julius Caesar, Brutus and Cassius for a 30-second production introducing its new state-of-the-art ham slicer.

 Fredric William Tokars, a lawyer and former prosecutor in Atlanta, was found guilty today of murder in the shotgun slaying of his wife, Sara Ambrusco Tokars, in front of her children in November 1992. 
 The jurors deliberated about 10 hours on Friday and today before deciding that Mr. Tokars had planned the slaying. He could receive the death penalty; testimony in the sentencing phase of the trial will begin on Sunday. The trial is being held here, between Atlanta and Chattanooga, Tenn., because of pretrial publicity. 
 The prosecution said Mr. Tokars had paid Eddie C. Lawrence, a former business associate of Mr. Tokars and a drug dealer, to kill his wife. Mr. Tokars had bought a $1.75 million insurance policy on his wife's life. Mr. Lawrence has told investigators that he hired another man, Curtis A. Rower, to carry out the slaying. 
 Mr. Tokars, an ambitious lawyer, was once a prosecutor and a judge. 
 The prosecutor, Tom Charron, painted Mr. Tokars as a cold-hearted, selfish man who had planned the brutal slaying of his wife in detail so  she would not divorce him and take away his assets. 
 Mr. Tokars was convicted in 1994 on Federal racketeering and money laundering charges, which included arranging the death of his wife. He has already been sentenced to life in Federal prison without parole. 
 Before her death, Mrs. Tokars had apparently discovered that her husband was involved in laundering drug money. She told friends that she was considering leaving Mr. Tokars, but was afraid to do so. 
 On the day of the slaying, the Tokars' two boys, Rick and Michael,  were kidnapped along with Mrs. Tokars by the man who became their mother's killer. With the boys, then 2  and 6, in the back seat of a car, the killer shot Mrs. Tokars in the head. 
 Rick, the oldest child, testified in Mr. Rower's trial. The boy broke down on the witness stand as he recalled how he had watched his mother plead for her life with ''a mean man.'' The lawyers agreed to use the transcript of that testimony in Mr. Tokars' trial rather than ask the boy to relive the killing again by testifying. 
 In a plea bargain, Mr. Lawrence pleaded guilty to a murder charge, got a life sentence and agreed to testify against Mr. Tokars. Mr. Rower was convicted of kidnapping, robbery and assault, but the jury deadlocked on a murder charge. A new trial is planned."

 WNYC, the public radio station that offers classical music on its FM band and news and talk on its AM band, has started its biggest advertising campaign ever to recruit more listeners and assert its newly acquired independence from New York City government. 
 The campaign features posters on 250 buses and 50 telephone kiosks around the city with slogans such as ''Did you hear what they said on WNYC?'' and ''Your home for NPR News.'' There are similar WNYC promotions running on Channel 13. 
 The campaign comes at a critical time for WNYC, which became independent earlier this year. While its audience has been increasing -- the  FM band (93.9) now has 500,000 listeners, the AM band (820) 400,000 -- its future is more vulnerable to the vagaries of the market without the safety net of city financing. 
 ''It's an extremely competitive, changing world,'' said Laura Walker, president of WNYC. ''And part of the challenge is to let people know that we're not a sleepy municipal broadcaster, that we have two vibrant radio stations which reflect the diversity and richness and humor of New York.'' 
 The campaign for WNYC is scheduled to run two months. Part of the estimated cost of $350,000 is being financed by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and TIG Holdings Inc. WNYC also received pro bono assistance from Jerry & Ketchum, an ad agency.

"251","Cone, the Super Fan, Looking for a Playoff Atmosphere",936748,"|sports",13,6,1997,"19970613T000000",NA," 
 Appropriately and perhaps adeptly, David Cone will be the first Yankee to pitch in an interleague skirmish when New York opposes the Florida Marlins in Miami tonight. But if you listen to Cone discuss the event, he sounds more like a public relations director for the virtues of the American League against the National League than a pitcher in a historic game. 
 Over and over yesterday, Cone repeated his sermon about the tingly feelings he expects to experience and expects others to feel now that clubs from baseball's opposite leagues are playing games before the World Series for the first time. Cone sounded like a super flak who is a super fan. 
 ''I think the fans are going to make it special,'' said Cone. ''You're going to have a lot of electricity in the stands. The fans are going to be into it. To me, fans can dictate the atmosphere. They can make it a playoff-type atmosphere. They can pump up players.'' 
 Not every player shared Cone's sentiments. 
 ''It's just another game,'' said Mariano Rivera. ''It doesn't matter.'' 
 An unfazed Cecil Fielder added: ''I'm not overjoyed about it. It's on the schedule so you go play.'' 
 But while several of Cone's teammates called the journey to Pro Player Stadium just another trip in a long season, the pitcher insisted there was something important about tonight's contest and something extraordinary about the three-game series with the Mets that begins Monday night at Yankee Stadium. Cone claimed fans will love the new matchups and he made an astounding 16 references to fans in a 10-minute interview. Such lavish attention to fans has not been voiced since an overzealous 12-year-old poked his glove over the right-field fence for a huge impact on last year's American League Championship Series. 
 ''There's an element of excitement in the air,'' said Cone, who will oppose Al Leiter, a former Yankee. ''I think the fans are into this experiment. I think the excitement will be up. I think the attendance will be up.'' 
 Cone has that right, for all three games in Miami this weekend and all three at Yankee Stadium next week are sold out. The Marlins have been averaging 28,229 fans a game, but the interleague contests will average 41,855, an inflation that was surely influenced by the Yankees' having trained in nearby Fort Lauderdale, Fla., from 1962 to 1995. The Yankees have averaged 25,369, but the encounters with the rival Mets in the Bronx will average 57,545. 
 ''If you're a Yankee or a Met fan, you've been waiting for this for your whole life,'' said Joe Girardi, looking to Monday. 
 But before the Yankees tangle with the Mets in the series that George Steinbrenner -- and Steinbrenner alone -- probably considers the most pivotal of the season, they must tussle with Florida. The Marlins (37-26), who are in second place in the National League East, have a better record than the defending World Series champion Yankees (36-27), who are second in the American League East. But the records are not relevant. 
 ''There are Yankee fans everywhere we go,'' said Cone. ''You know there will be a lot of transplanted New Yorkers there.'' 
 Cone is the perfect pitcher in this spot because he has a National League background from six years with the Mets and because attention-grabbing games never bother him. But it might bother him to bat in a National League park; the last time he did that in a regular-season game was Aug. 23, 1992. Cone, who had 61 hits in 395 at-bats (.154 average) for the Mets, is not predicting miracles. 
 ''The most important thing is getting down a bunt,'' Cone said. ''The chances of our pitchers getting a hit is pretty remote.'' 
 There will be no designated hitter in the series, so Manager Joe Torre has the ticklish choice of picking between Fielder and Tino Martinez at first base. Since Leiter is the only left-hander starting for Florida, the right-handed Fielder (1 for 12 off Leiter) might start over Martinez (1 for 9) tonight. 
 ''I'm not a fan of this,'' said Torre. ''But I think it's going to be electric out there. I think the fans are going to be into it. As much against it as I am, I think this stuff is going to be fun.''

 To the Editor: 
 As you report (news article, June 20), the Supreme Court decided that Joseph O'Dell could be executed by Virginia even though the jury that sentenced him to death was not told that if it spared his life, he would never be released from prison. 
 This violated a rule that the Court has recognized since 1994. Still, the Court ruled, Mr. O'Dell may be executed because -- in the view of a 5-to-4 majority -- the rule had not been clearly established in 1988, when Mr. O'Dell's initial appeals ran out. 
 As the Association of the Bar of the City of New York concluded in 1989, a system that so transfers the risk of legal uncertainty from the government that created it to the citizen whom that government seeks to execute is antithetical to fundamental principles of justice. 
 Moreover, the practical effect is to reward stalling tactics. A prisoner who has somehow managed to keep his or her case tied up in the state courts will benefit from favorable changes in the law, while his or her more diligent co-defendant, convicted on the same day of the same crime, will not. 
 Unless Gov. George Allen rescues Mr. O'Dell, he will go to the electric chair simply because he presented a meritorious legal argument before the courts had agreed on its correctness.

 Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, today denied a published report that his office was investigating the personal life of President Clinton while he was Governor of Arkansas. 
 In a statement issued this afternoon, Mr. Starr called ''incorrect'' an article in The Washington Post that said he was investigating Mr. Clinton's personal life by interviewing former and current state troopers in Arkansas about their knowledge of any extramarital relationships Mr. Clinton may have had. 
 Previously published accounts have said the troopers alleged that Mr. Clinton had such affairs. The Post article said that the questioning ''marks a sharp departure from previous avenues of inquiry in the three-year-old investigation'' of the Whitewater matter. 
 Federal agents from the Whitewater independent counsel's office have been talking to state troopers in Arkansas about Mr. Clinton's relationships with women since 1994, when the independent counsel was Robert B. Fiske Jr., people involved in the investigation said. They said the investigators conducted the interviews as part of an effort to corroborate other information that they had about Mr. Clinton's financial dealings with his former Whitewater partner, James B. McDougal. 
 Mr. Starr would not say who has been interviewed by his staff, but he said in his statement that there was nothing improper about seeking information from all possible sources that might bear on his examination of Mr. Clinton's financial dealings."

"255","Clinton to Ask $350 Million To Train Teachers for Poor",944277,"|education|u.s.",17,7,1997,"19970717T000000","|United States"," 
 President Clinton plans to ask Congress to spend $350 million over the next five years to help recruit and train teachers for impoverished school districts, Administration officials said today. 
 Mr. Clinton is to announce the proposal in a speech on Thursday to the N.A.A.C.P.'s national convention in Pittsburgh. Officials said the plan would be the centerpiece of the speech, in which the President will call again for support of his effort to set national standards for education and to raise low expectations that, he will argue, are holding back many poor students. 
 The President is already negotiating with the Republican-controlled  Congress for $35 billion in college tuition assistance over the next five years. But he has come under fire from some liberals and members of minority groups, who contend that he is shorting the needs of students who are struggling in elementary or high school, with scant hope of attending college unless their education improves. In earlier budget negotiations, Mr. Clinton backed away from his proposal for $5 billion to rebuild deteriorating public schools. 
 The new proposal, Administration officials said, dovetails with the President's broader effort to institute national voluntary testing against standards in reading and math, beginning in 1999. The President plans to say on Thursday that to meet those standards, poor students must have teachers with the background, the expertise and the commitment to help them succeed, officials said. 
 ''We've got to set standards for those kids, and we've got to set standards for what's happening in those classrooms,'' one senior White House official said today. 
 The Department of Education estimates that because of rising enrollments and teacher retirements, the nation's public schools will need one  million new teachers over the next five years. 
 Of those, about 350,000 will be needed in the poorest urban and rural schools, the Administration says. The hope is that the new program will help train 10 percent of this number, some 35,000. 
 If it wins Congressional approval, the program will begin in the fall of 1998. The Administration hopes the effort will not only increase the number of teachers in poor districts but  also improve their preparation. 
 Under the plan, grants would be offered through the Department of Education to postgraduate education training programs. To qualify for the grants, the training programs would have to form partnerships with poor  school districts, either urban or rural, to recruit and train teachers. 
 Further, they would have to identify particular needs that those teachers would fill, like expertise in mathematics or English. A teacher might also be intended to match a district's ''demographic needs'' for, say, black or Hispanic educators to provide role models, said an official familiar with the plan's details. 
 The Administration's hope is that many training programs will compete for the grants, giving the Department of Education its pick of the best prepared. Each program would have to demonstrate that with the grant, it would increase the total number of teachers it prepares. 
 ''They're going to have to increase their output for this,'' the official said, ''not just maintain their output and shift their sources of funding.'' 
 The teacher training programs that received grant money would use it to help support students who promised to teach in poor districts for three years. Average tuition assistance for a participant would probably be about $3,000 a year, the official said, although some programs might also offer transportation or child care assistance to older students. ''We're deliberately building some flexibility in here,'' he said. 
 In response to the proposal, Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of the Great City Schools, a coalition of the nation's largest urban public school systems, said: ''Finally somebody is paying attention to what the need is. The shortage of teachers in the cities is already profound, and most urban school districts have a real problem recruiting and training teachers.'' 
 Mr. Casserly called the proposal ''a real constructive start.'' 
 The President plans for the legislation creating the program to be sent to Congress later this summer. It is not clear what reception it will get; Republicans there rejected Mr. Clinton's $5 billion plan to rebuild schools, with some calling it an unwarranted Federal intrusion into local affairs. 
 The Administration's proposal is modeled on a program run by the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund to recruit and train teachers for poor schools. That program supplies grants covering 80 percent of  tuition costs for teacher training. 
 Since 1989, the fund has spent about $40 million on 2,134 participants, said Bruce S. Trachtenberg, a spokesman. 
 ''The next step,'' he said, ''and the real test of the program, will be, How much of a success will they be as teachers?''"
"256","Sculpture With an Aura of Ritual and Myth",948083,"|new york|region",3,8,1997,"19970803T000000",NA," 
 IN contemporary culture, a sculpture no longer functions as an idol, and only rarely -- usually unsuccessfully -- as a monument. So what may appear to be a search for meaning in modern sculpture often turns out to involve a nostalgia for the devotional and memorial functions of which it has been unburdened, or robbed, depending on your point of view. 
 It may be that the three sculptors whose work is gathered in ''Ancient Emblems, Contemporary Signifiers'' at the Jersey City Museum -- Marion E. Held, Ming Fay and Tova Beck-Friedman -- are motivated by that kind of nostalgia. Certainly that is the implication of the curator Alejandro Anreus's contention that ''all three look through the lens of so-called 'primitive' civilizations and myths to sharpen their vision and understanding of our own society.'' 
 Yet it is hard to tell how important this affinity for ancient myth really is for these artists' work. Lacking overt allusions to particular myths or rituals, their primitive resonances seem vague. Although Ms. Beck-Friedman, for instance, has said that her art ''is informed by archetypal images of the Feminine as expressed in ancient myths,'' it's hard to find anything particularly feminine or mythical in her group of five towering monoliths here. Rather, these upright, abstract forms, despite some echoes of human postures, are more reminiscent of trees or rock formations. Are we meant to think of old tales of metamorphoses, like that of Daphne, who became a laurel tree? Maybe. But these forms express stasis, not transformation. 
 The dark gray, granular surface of these sculptures resembles granite, yet somehow it is immediately apparent to the eye that materially these volumes are somehow lighter, softer, less dense than might seem to be the case -- perhaps even hollow. And in fact they turn out to be made of pulped paper, not stone. Their title, ''Memory Imprints,'' suggests that they embody distant memories of sculptures past, of ancient stelae and ruined architectural fragments. Since any of those things would have been carved out of obdurate stone rather than molded from a friable, malleable material like paper, Ms. Beck-Friedman's sculpture poses the problem of its own lack of reality in comparison to its models, the sense that its recollection of the past may be no more than a fiction. 
 This sense of unreality is even more explicit in the five works by Mr. Fay, highly detailed -- one might almost say hyper-real -- depictions of plant forms at much greater than actual size. At times these representations seem quite literal, as in two works effectively displayed hanging from the ceiling: ''Berries'' (1997) and ''Elixirs'' (1988), which is a pair of hairy root vegetables that could easily, aside from the change of scale, have come from the exotic offerings of a Chinatown vegetable market. But some of the others have an implicit air of science fiction about them: they might just be unfamiliar but quite real plants, yet they seem to be weird hybrids. Again, despite all the loving attention that has clearly been given to details of texture and color, these sculptures highlight their own unreality, not only through scale but also through devices like the holes in ''Curl Tusk'' (1987), which allow the viewer to glimpse the hollow interior and the underlying armature of the piece. 
 Like Ms. Beck-Friedman, Ms. Held uses natural forms abstractly, particularly a simple concave form, reminiscent of a turtle shell, that she makes in ashen stoneware. With variations, this same form appears again and again in her three sculptures here, sometimes open, often paired to create a cell-like structure that can in turn be combined into extended configurations. Despite attempts to endow these units with pathos -- ''Clear Tube'' (1996), with its implication of a being on life support, or ''Metal Crib 2'' (1997), with its implication of infantile helplessness -- they are simply not interesting enough to arouse empathy. Ms. Held's insistence on the shape (there can be dozens in a single work like ''Passages'') only magnifies the viewer's sense of its triviality. 
 T HERE is something theatrically proplike about the work of all three sculptors, although in Ms. Beck-Friedman's and Mr. Fay's work the resulting ambiguities lend interest, even though they ultimately limit its power. All the more reason to appreciate the directness of ''Deception, Betrayal, Loss,'' the work of another sculptor, Chris Griffin, in the museum's West Gallery. Despite the portentous title, the work tells another story: cool, precise and light of touch, it teasingly flirts with sentimentality but knows just where to stop. 
 Best in show here is 'The Garden'' (1997), in which a thick mass of colorful silk flowers is gathered in a paintinglike rectangle on the wall. To the right, almost eclipsed by its brightness, is a black veil or sheer scarf on which a grid of small white crosses appears. With its funereal implications, this smaller and less conspicuous element suddenly transforms the festive appearance of the silken garden: one suddenly realizes its proportions are about right for a cemetery plot. Ms. Griffin has contrived a neat, resonant interchange of extremes -- from joy to mourning and, perhaps, back again -- with a delight in the artifice of her means and no heavy rhetoric. 
 Although not every piece is quite so successful, each has the merit of being quite distinct as well as concise in both its means and its implications. Unbeholden to a given form, format or material, this work offers multiplicity, not importunity. In ''Hands'' (1997), the plaster palms that stretch out from the wall proffer a seemingly random assortment of odd little trinkets -- a celestial blue marble with white stars inscribed on it, a wax nipple, a cagelike wire-mesh house -- as if to say that art itself is a simple gesture of ostension, like the one by which the martyred saints in old painting serenely exhibit the instruments of their torment.

"257","Republic Reaches a Preliminary Pact With Toyota on Dealerships",953172,"|business",26,8,1997,"19970826T000000",NA," 
 It is one down and one to go for H. Wayne Huizenga's Republic Industries, the nation's largest car dealership owner. 
 Republic, which has been feuding in the courts with the United States arm of the Toyota Motor Company and with the American Honda Motor Company, reached a preliminary agreement late yesterday with Toyota that would allow Republic to buy more Toyota dealerships and would end litigation between the two sides. The deal with Toyota came after more than six hours of meetings in Dallas between the two sides. 
 dr 
 Neither company would disclose details of the framework agreement last night. But given the public animosity between the two only days ago, the announcement seemed to signal a breakthrough. ''We've agreed to agree,'' said Nancy J. Hubbell, a Toyota spokeswoman. She added that both sides had given in to the other's demands. 
 For the last nine months, Republic has been snapping up car dealerships nationwide, with the blessing of many auto makers that are eager to thin the ranks of their dealers and modernize the dealerships. Toyota and Honda, however, have resisted. Each adopted policies intended to slow sales to large dealer groups like Republic, and each sued Republic when it refused to stop making offers to buy dealers. 
 Republic countersued. Watching its stock price fall by nearly half this year, Mr. Huizenga then accused the Japanese auto makers of trying to drive down the price of Republic stock by creating uncertainty. Republic has often used its stock as currency for buying dealerships. 
 The deal announced yesterday was reached after the stock market closed. Earlier, shares of Republic, rose 25 cents, to $23.4375, on the New York Stock Exchange. In June, the stock hit a low of $20.3125. 
 Wall Street analysts were cautious about the possible impact of an agreement, given the uncertainty over the details. 
 ''A lot depends on the structure of the agreement: how many Toyota dealers they are allowed to buy,'' said David B. Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham Securities. ''A lot more depends on Republic's stock price than it does the agreement with Toyota.'' 
 After the meeting yesterday, Republic and Toyota issued a joint statement: ''We are very happy that Toyota and Republic have reached the framework of an agreement that will be mutually beneficial to both companies, while protecting the interests of customers and dealers.'' 
 Even if Republic's preliminary agreement with Toyota is carried through to a broad deal, there is still a gulf between Republic and Honda. Earlier yesterday, Honda asked the Federal District Court in Los Angeles for a preliminary injunction barring Republic from acquiring any more of its dealerships. 
 Honda had already filed a lawsuit on May 7 asking the same court to halt Republic's acquisitions on the grounds that the speed and scale of the purchases violated the auto maker's dealership policies and could hurt the auto maker's reputation if Republic proved unable to manage the dealerships. Republic has said that both legal actions are without merit. 
 But after the Toyota deal was announced, Honda seemed hopeful. Michael L. Spencer, a spokesman for American Honda, said that the auto maker had not been invited to the Dallas meeting and did not participate in it. ''We're a little bit surprised'' by the agreement, he said. 
 Mr. Spencer said that while Honda did not have any settlement talks scheduled with Republic, the company was encouraged by tonight's deal. ''Hopefully this signals a new evolution within Republic, that they're now more willing to negotiate and make concessions,'' he said, while adding, ''We're not willing to tear up our dealership agreements for them.'' 
 Even the agreement with Toyota leaves many issues to be resolved. Ms. Hubbell, the Toyota spokeswoman, said that no date had yet been set for the additional negotiations that would be necessary to reach a full deal."

 FLOWER NET 
 By Lisa See. 
 333 pp. New York: 
 HarperCollins Publishers. $24. 
 ''Women hold up half the sky,'' Mao Zedong once famously pronounced, but in ''Flower Net,'' Lisa See's colorful first novel about murder and mayhem on both sides of the Pacific, the ratio seems more like 60-40. Liu Hulan, the female component of the book's Chinese-American investigative team, is an inspector for the Ministry of Public Security in Beijing. David Stark, her male counterpart, is a high-minded assistant United States attorney from Los Angeles. And while both characters play a role in unraveling the novel's central mystery, it's the street-smart Hulan who carries most of the weight. 
 The story begins one cold January day when the corpse of the American Ambassador's son is found frozen in the ice of Beihai, a lake just outside the Forbidden City. Ten days later, another body is found -- this time, it's the son of a prominent Beijing businessman -- on a boat adrift off the California coast. In an unusual example of Chinese-American cooperation, Hulan and David are paired up to solve the related cases and spend most of the novel hopping from Beijing to L.A. and back again as the circle of suspicion grows to encompass shady types in both cities. Complicating the investigation is Hulan and David's shared history; they were lovers back in the 1980's, when the two worked together for an American law firm. 
 All in all, this is an inviting premise for a thriller, and Lisa See (author of the family memoir ''On Gold Mountain'') capitalizes on its inherent novelty and exoticism. Readers familiar with present-day Beijing, where a few warrenlike traditional neighborhoods still hold out against the onslaught of garish hotels and office buildings, will take delight in her local descriptions, from the ubiquitous street carts selling candied crab apples to the shining Mercedes-Benzes hooting their way through swarms of Flying Pigeon bicycles. She's particularly successful at conveying the sights and smells of Beijing's raw winters, when the air is ''thick with coal smoke, exhaust and the freezing fog's lingering dampness.'' 
 But when it comes to plotting, See unfortunately adopts the old policy of letting a hundred improbabilities bloom. Yes, she has done her homework (characters are continually providing us with thumbnail lectures on everything from the history of Chinese triads to the finer points of traditional medicine), but a nagging aura of inauthenticity hangs over the novel's investigative mechanics. In the China I know, for instance, obtaining information of any kind is always a frustrating struggle, but the Chinese in this book seem willing to bare their secrets at the slightest provocation. (At one point, a triad boss, after a few minutes of chitchat, obligingly reveals the details of a smuggling operation to an unknown man posing as a courier.) And in See's China there seems to be a curious practice of leaving incriminating bankbooks around for anyone to find. 
 Happily, the novelist is much better with characters -- at least with the ones who are Chinese. Although Stark is constructed largely from crime-novel boilerplate (right down to the ex-wife who left him because he cared more about Justice than about his family), Hulan is a provocative mixture of vulnerability, bitterness and hardheaded practicality. A veteran of the wrenching ideological struggles of the Cultural Revolution, she has learned that succeeding in China means mastering ''the art of keeping her emotions in check, of hiding her thoughts, of presenting a placid facade to the world.'' Her subtlety and complexity stand in, er, stark contrast to her partner's two-dimensional sanctimoniousness -- leading one to hope that next time around she'll ditch the foreign-devil boyfriend and team up with someone of her own caliber.

"259","Computers Model World's Climate, but How Well?",970364,"|technology|science|health",4,11,1997,"19971104T000000",NA," 
 TOM'S RESTAURANT at 112th Street and Broadway in Upper  Manhattan is right out of ''Seinfeld.'' But six floors above, Dr. Makiko Sato and Dr. James E. Hansen are conjuring up a bigger world from the innards of what looks like a slightly oversized personal computer. This is no ordinary computer, however. It contains the earth's atmosphere and oceans, albeit in mathematical form, interconnected to create a virtual global climate system. 
 About 20 of these ocean-atmosphere climate models now exist, four times as many as a decade ago. They are the principal tools available to researchers who are trying to understand how the global climate is changing. By pumping data on temperature, winds, solar radiation, ocean currents and a host of other climatic factors into a model and then setting it in motion, scientists can simulate what could happen over time if emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases increase. 
 These simulations are the basis of predictions that the average surface temperature of the earth will rise substantially and disrupt the world's climate in coming decades unless there are reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which is produced by the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil. 
 The models' forecast -- a unanimous one -- has been accepted uncritically as gospel by some environmentalists and even some scientists and dismissed as all but worthless by some opponents of emissions reductions. Most experts take a middle stance, saying that while the models are getting more realistic all the time, they remain relatively crude versions of reality whose findings should be interpreted with care. 
 So how useful are the models as policy guides for the nations of the world as they prepare to meet in Kyoto, Japan, on Dec. 1 to negotiate cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases? 
 One hint materializes from the computer above Tom's, one of several like it in the offices of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Dr. Sato, a physicist and climate researcher, punches keys, and world maps appear on her computer's monitor. In vivid colors ranging from yellow to orange to dark red (for degrees of warmth) through shades of blue (for degrees of cold), maps on the right of the screen show the pattern of global temperature changes the computer climate model ''predicted'' for the period 1979 to 1995. Maps on the left show the changes that actually took place. 
 The picture presented by the comparison is clear: In broadest terms, the computer got it right; the world as a whole warmed, and the Northern Hemisphere warmed most. But it also got a lot of the regional details wrong. The computer said that eastern Canada should have warmed substantially, for instance, but, instead, it cooled a lot. 
 Not a lot of stock should be placed in a single ''run'' of a single model, or even in many runs. But many runs of many models present the same picture suggested by the maps on Dr. Sato's screen: that the models show a general global fidelity to reality but also pervasive regional error. They also continue to yield the same general conclusion their much cruder predecessors first yielded nearly two decades ago: that a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere would raise the earth's average surface temperature by three to eight degrees Fahrenheit.  The wide range is a measure of the differences among model projections, and thus of the uncertainty inherent in climate modeling. 
 A doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations is expected late in the next century if the world pursues business as usual. To get an idea of the magnitude of the models' forecast, one should consider that the world is five to nine degrees warmer now than in the depths of the last ice age. 
 Despite the models' inability to simulate the regional details of climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists advising the climate negotiations under United Nations auspices, says its confidence in the models is growing. Not only have the models become more sophisticated and detailed, the scientists say, they have also successfully passed some important reality checks by simulating actual climate changes with reasonable accuracy. 
 The models are exhibiting ''a progressive convergence toward what has happened in nature,'' said Dr. W. Lawrence Gates, a climatologist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California who has long been a leader of systematic international efforts, including those of the intergovernmental panel, to evaluate the models. 
 For making long-term predictions of climatic change on a continental scale or greater, Dr. Gates said, ''the ensemble of existing modern models is reliable'' and ''provides a firm scientific base for policy.'' 
 Not everyone agrees. Some skeptics, like Dr. Richard S. Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have always considered the models worthless as prognosticators, and still do. ''I'm not saying the model output bears no resemblance at all to nature; in the gross figures, it looks plausibly similar,'' Dr. Lindzen said. But that, he said, ''does not give you forecast ability.'' 
 No model, by definition, will ever match the real world perfectly. ''It's never going to happen,'' said Dr. Hansen, the director of the Goddard Institute. A decade ago, Dr. Hansen became the first scientist to go on record before Congress and say that the greenhouse effect was probably the cause of global warming. 
 Models will always fail to mimic nature exactly, he says, even though today's smaller but much faster computers make possible a precision unapproached by the lumbering mainframe that occupied an entire floor above Tom's some 20 years ago, when the Hansen team became one of the first to simulate global climate -- and even though still faster computers are just over the horizon. 
 For one thing, the atmosphere's normal internal churnings are to some extent unpredictable; some variations are never repeated exactly. As Dr. Hansen put it, ''the climate in any year is like a snowflake; no two are alike.'' The same can be said for decades and centuries. For another thing, the atmosphere is far too complex to be completely captured in any computer program. The essence of modeling is to simplify but to retain the processes most important in driving the climate. 
 Nevertheless, proponents of the models say, they are the most powerful tools available for analyzing climate. While the incessant pouring of greenhouse gases into the air by industrial activity constitutes an experiment of sorts, there is no way to know how it will turn out without waiting for several decades. Why turn to computers? The atmosphere is simply too complex for any other mode of analysis, and the virtual climate made possible by computers is far closer to reality than any model that might be generated in anyone's head, the model proponents say. 
 Some things about climate are simple and certain enough, needing no computer analysis. Scientists know, for instance, that a doubling of carbon dioxide, by itself, would warm the earth's surface by about two degrees. They also know that atmospheric concentrations of the gas are increasing as a result of industrial activity. 
 But simplicity ends there. The warming touches off feedback processes, some of which increase the warming and some of which decrease it. For instance, a warmer atmosphere melts snow and sea ice, both of which cool the planet by reflecting sunlight; less ice and snow  means further warming. On the other hand, warming also increases low-level clouds, which cool the planet. 
 Modeling is in large measure an exercise in representing enough of these competing influences faithfully enough to estimate their net effect.  The most important of the feedback influences, perhaps, involves water vapor, the most powerful greenhouse gas of all. An atmosphere warmed by carbon dioxide produces more vapor, and this amplification is critical to the models' forecasts of future warming. 
 A climate model is a computer program containing mathematical equations that express fundamental laws of atmospheric physics. These laws govern the interlinked workings of the sun, atmosphere, oceans, land and other elements of the climate system. The various feedback influences are also expressed mathematically. The computer calculates the extent to which the basic physical laws dictate changes in things like temperature and precipitation over time and under different conditions.  For instance, modelers can introduce any sort of ''forcing'' influence they want -- increasing greenhouse gases, for instance -- to see what would happen over decades and centuries. 
 One big limitation of the models in predicting the climate decades ahead is that despite the growing speed of computers, they are unable to calculate climatic changes everywhere in the atmosphere. Instead, they make the calculations only at widely separated points. The points form a three-dimensional grid typically rising 10 or 12 miles above the earth. A typical spacing between grid points is about 150 miles horizontally and less than half a mile vertically. This ''resolution,'' as scientists call it, is about twice as fine as a decade ago. But it still misses many processes that happen between grid points -- cloud formation, for example. So modelers approximate these factors as best they can. 
 Coarse resolution is also the major reason why the models are not very good at simulating climate at the regional scale. They simply miss too many small-scale climatic influences, like topography, vegetation and regional atmospheric churnings.  Some modelers have developed techniques for overcoming this. For instance, they might model only part of the ocean-atmosphere system, using much more closely spaced grid points, to get a better fix on regional changes. That approach has been successfully employed, for instance, in predicting the comings and goings of El Nino, the vast pool of tropical Pacific water that disrupts weather around the world. 
 In another technique, modelers take the general results of a global climate model and use them to construct a second model of higher resolution for a limited region. Researchers at Pennsylvania State University have so far successfully used this ''nesting'' technique to reproduce observed precipitation patterns in the Middle Atlantic region. 
 As computers become more advanced, the resolution of models continues to improve. Researchers at a number of Federal laboratories are collaborating in the development of a next-generation model using several computers operating in parallel. The ocean part of the model has a horizontal grid spacing of less than 20 miles, which researchers believe is necessary to represent fine-scale ocean eddies and currents. 
 It is only in the last few years that models have included deep-ocean processes, which are critical to the climate system's functioning. The ocean, for instance, absorbs both carbon dioxide and heat, transports heat from one part of the planet to the other and provides moisture to the atmosphere. 
 An even bigger limitation of the models than coarse resolution is the incomplete knowledge of the atmosphere's functioning, Dr. Hansen says. Dr. Gates agrees, saying, ''How the natural world works -- that's always going to be our problem.'' 
 Still, the models have been steadily incorporating more and more features of the climate system. One of the most important, in terms of model realism, has been the effect of tiny solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the atmosphere. The modern economy produces a lot of these aerosols, as they are called, most notably sulfur dioxide droplets emitted by industry. Aerosols cool parts of the planet by reflecting sunlight. Before this effect was included in the models, they consistently produced more global warming than was being observed. Afterward, the model representations and the observations agreed more closely. 
 With the aerosol effect factored in, the intergovernmental science panel estimates that the average global temperature will rise by two to six degrees in the next century, with a best estimate of about three and a half degrees, barring cuts in greenhouse emissions. The warming will continue after that, the panel says. 
 The biggest gap in knowledge, many scientists believe, is that the net effect of clouds on the planet's temperature is still unknown. While low-level clouds reflect heat, high-level clouds trap it. Moreover, experts do not fully understand how water vapor behaves when the atmosphere warms. The amount by which vapor amplifies the warming therefore remains uncertain. 
 Dr. Lindzen has long maintained that the models simply get the physics of the water vapor feedback wrong, at least at high altitudes. The United Nations panel says the amplification clearly takes place at lower altitudes but concedes the uncertainty about higher altitudes. 
 Even if such uncertainties are somehow resolved, modelers will  never be sure that they have included all the information necessary for realism. ''With any models, what you never know is what you haven't put in,'' said Dr. Jeremiah P. Ostriker of Princeton University, who comes at computer modeling from a different perspective, that of an astrophysicist who uses models to study the cosmos. The best reality check, he said, ''is to see how well you can match the real world.'' 
 By that standard, on the plus side, mainstream scientists say the models reproduce the main features of present-day climate, including the seasonal cycle, the comings and goings of monsoons, the seasonal shift of major rain belts and storm tracks, the average daily temperature cycle and many large-scale features of ocean circulation. 
 In the last two years, Dr. Gates said, models have for the first time reproduced the magnitude and frequency of the climate system's natural internal fluctuations on several time scales. ''A number of them now have simulated variability that looks realistic,'' he said. But, he said, the unpredictability inherent in these fluctuations makes it impossible to predict their timing, and always will. 
 The models have also reproduced, at least in general outline, the changes in global climate observed in the last century. These include not only a general global warming of about one degree but also broad patterns of temperature change, both geographically and vertically,  through the atmosphere. 
 When the Mount Pinatubo volcano erupted in the Philippines in 1991, sending aloft a global haze of planet-cooling aerosols, the Goddard model predicted that the cooling would be about one degree at its low point and would last about two years. That is what actually happened. To many experts, that indicates that the model faithfully reflects the climate system's sensitivity to heating and cooling influences from outside -- whether they be aerosols or greenhouse gases. 
 Models have also simulated the climate of the last ice age and come up with an average global temperature about seven degrees lower than today's, well within the cold period's actual temperature range. 
 But the models do not always match reality this well. One major shortcoming, for instance, is that the global models fail to simulate accurately the major temperature swings associated with El Nino. And there is that biggest deficiency of all:  the failure to predict climatic change accurately on a regional scale. 
 In sum, the models are still cloudy crystal balls. But they are getting clearer, and they offer some answers. 
 ''Despite all the uncertainties, I think you can make useful estimates'' of climatic change using the models, said Dr. Andrew P. Ingersoll, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology who employs them to investigate the climates of other planets. 
 ''You just have to be aware of the uncertainties,'' he said. ''It's just like any other scientific process.''

"261","Much-Debated Mall Runs Into a New Delay: Toxic Hazard",975255,"|new york|region",23,11,1997,"19971123T000000","|New York City"," 
 The start of construction of a 15-acre shopping center in Forest Hills will be delayed for at least a year while a toxic industrial solvent that was found in the soil and ground water is cleaned up, state health officials said. 
 Dangerous levels of perchloroethylene were discovered by inspectors from the State Department of Environmental Conservation underneath buildings on a lot between Metropolitan Boulevard and Union Turnpike and bound to the west by Woodhaven Boulevard. Home Depot, Staples and Sports Authority have planned to erect megastores there. Perchloroethylene, a solvent commonly used in dry cleaning that is also known as perc, is a carcinogen. 
 Environmental officials said perc levels had been found to be 8,000 parts per million in the topsoil, compared with an acceptable level of 1.4 parts per million, and 24,000 parts per billion in the groundwater, far above the acceptable level of 5 parts per billion. 
 ''The concentration of the toxin is so high in some areas that it may require demolition of some of the buildings,'' said Mary Ellen Chris, regional director of the Department of Environmental Conservation. At least 10 feet of topsoil will have to be removed and the ground water aerated, she said. The agency is continuing to try to determine the source of the perc. 
 Jesse Masyr, a lawyer for Home Depot, said the discovery of the toxic chemical would not be a major setback. ''This removal project was already factored into the development of the area,'' he said. ''We, in fact, were the people who tipped off the D.E.C. about potential pollution problems.'' Mr. Masyr said he thought that the cleanup could be completed  in two months and that construction might begin as early as next year. 
 The proposed development has sparked arguments between residents who believe it will saturate their neighborhood with traffic and destroy its small-town feel and politicians and developers, who say the stores will bring badly needed jobs to the city. 
 One group of residents has filed a lawsuit seeking to stop construction.  Jack Lester, a lawyer for the residents, said the discovery of the toxic material supported their claim that the shopping center would be a detriment to the neighborhood. 
 ''The contamination is precisely what we argued in our lawsuit in trying to stop this thing,'' Mr. Lester said. ''We managed to shut them down, at least for a while.''

 I'M sticky, sticky, sticky with patches. There's a bright blue one on my wrist, ''impregnated with the oil of a tropical orchid,'' in the words of its inventor, a chef in Ilkley, England. If I take little sniffs of it, the maker promises, I won't want to eat anything sweet. 
 I've had patches like tiny plaster casts over the bridge of my nose and bean-shape patches under my eyes. I've tried patches intended to destroy blemishes and some for spider veins and for muscle pain. It's all very ''Gattaca,'' I think -- very medical and modern and millennial -- and part of a trendlet rippling through the cosmetics industry. Patches are the latest gimmick, and maybe even the latest metaphor for how we think about our bodies, ourselves. 
 Not all patches do the same thing or work the same way. Most popular are Biore's Pore Perfect Strips. Perhaps you've seen the advertisement for them, which is riveting, in a bilious way. A young woman sports a strip patch over the bridge of her nose (a reference, perhaps, to the nose-job sight gag in the movie ''Clueless''?). Time passes. The heroine slowly, primly, peels off the strip. ''It unclogs pores by lifting out dirt, makeup, even blackheads'' -- she says, wincing slightly -- ''which you can see on the strip when you're done, if you like looking at that sort of thing.'' 
 The strips, $5.99 for a package of six, have been perfectly marketed; the company has held ''strip offs'' at malls and gave them away at last summer's Lilith Fair. Teen-age girls went gaga. According to a Nielsen survey, Biore was the best-selling skin-care product of 1997. 
 Even grown-ups were fascinated. ''I got as far as Duane Reade,'' said one stylish friend of mine, who wanted to give them a try. ''But I'd just had a little work done on my nose and I thought, Hmmm, better skip it.'' 
 I was less prudent. For my trouble, I suffered greatly when I removed the strip, which also removed all the little hairs on my nose. It did not, however, remove any ''stalagmites,'' as Richard Maksimoski, Biore's director of research and development, so carefully phrased it in a telephone chat. Ponds has recently begun selling a copycat strip; a new advertisement features a J. Crewlike gaggle of women pulling off strips and bonding over the results. 
 Less ruthless in intent are patches meant to deliver herbs and vitamins into the bloodstream through the skin. Now this is modern. It seems culturally appropriate to wear your medicine. A patch says, ''This is a health thing, not a vanity thing.'' 
 Infusia makes patches with Vitamin C for wrinkles ($26 for a box of 60), Vitamin K for broken capillaries, Saint Johnswort for muscle soreness and a cocktail of herbs and salicylic acid for blemishes. Another company, University Medical, makes a C patch in its Face Lift line, which is sold in drugstore chains, $9.95 for eight patches. Osmotics sells C patches called Derms at Saks, Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus, $125 for a packet of 48. 
 ''This is breakthrough stuff,'' said Steve Porter, a co-owner of Osmotics, maintaining that his patches work because they're left on for a long time. ''There have been studies on transdermal deliveries,'' he said, ''that concluded that the outer layer of the skin, which does its job by keeping things out, will, after a couple of hours of being occluded, or blocked, relax and start letting things in.'' Things like Vitamin C, this week's new-old wonder treatment for wrinkles. 
 The patches are appealing, in a clinical sort of way. The Osmotics Derms are clear, like invisible tape, and they're meant to be worn overnight or at least six hours. I applied them gleefully. Tap. Tap. One along each cheekbone. I thought: They cost a lot of money. They look so medical. Magic will be done tonight. 
 But the next day, it was Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! You're supposed to work the Derms off with oil that the company supplies, and I carefully mushed oil under them, as instructed, peeling back the edges ever so gently. But I had angry red swaths where the patches had been. I still had crow's-feet, but now I had chapped crow's-feet. Not a good look. 
 Patchwork, patch job. The wordplay the new patches inspire feels appropriate to the way some scientific experts feel about claims of the beauty industry. 
 Dr. John Bailey, director of the Office of Cosmetics and Colors at the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the cosmetics industry, said: ''This is a play on consumer perception. They know about the nicotine patch, and they say, 'Aha.' But there's no way of assessing the benefits in an unbiased way. We don't test them, and therefore you have to rely on the word of the company. You could take Saran Wrap and wind it around yourself, or cover yourself in Vaseline, and this will cause the skin to plump up for a short while. Is that a meaningful benefit?'' 
 I don't know. I think the patches are kind of fun, and a testimony to niche marketing; there's something appealing about breaking the face into bits in this way: eye patch, nose patch, neck patch. Like the decorative patches worn in earlier centuries -- vanity's response to smallpox scars -- the new patches could evolve as a sign language telegraphing political or sexual messages. 
 ''What is a patch?'' asked George Ledes, publisher and editor of Beauty/Fashion, a trade publication, and another skeptic. ''It's all been delivered in creams before, and now -- what? Your hands don't get dirty?'' 
 I love the Diet Scent patch (out in Britain  and coming soon, via infomercial, to a cable channel near you). ''You hide it up your sleeve,'' said Liz Paul, the English chef who invented it, ''and you take a big sniff whenever you are in the supermarket, and it stops you eating all those naughty things.'' The vanilla smell is faint, and I don't know if it works, but there's no denying that the bright blue patch looks marvelous. 
 Ms. Paul also makes a Love Patch. It's cranberry colored, and smells like cinnamon. It's supposed to mimic pheromones, those olfactory come-ons. Just take a sniff, and you want all those naughty things. 
 Speaking of fetishes, my friend Kim has been using a nicotine patch for about six months (more than three times the recommended length), and she says she's going to stay on it forever. ''Look, it's a life-style choice,'' she said. ''I need something transgressive in my life, and at this point it's either this patch or a tattoo.'' 
 How about a tattoo of a patch?  VIEW"
"265","Fascination in the Depression",993745,"|new york|region",8,2,1998,"19980208T000000",NA," 
 PRINTS line the walls of Herschel and Fern Cohen's  stately colonial home. From  floor to ceiling, stacked four or five high, up the stairs, down the hallway, in the office, bedrooms and bathrooms, hundreds of lithographs, wood engravings, woodcuts and etchings evoke images of the Depression era. Huddled masses, powerful workers, robust-looking ''fat cat'' capitalists, sharecroppers and coal miners, represented almost entirely in black and white, dominant the collection of realistic works. 
 This pre-eminent collection of  American prints depicting the Great Depression is the passion of a Wall Street portfolio manager who focuses on the psychology of investors and their swings from optimism to pessimism. 
 The images of breadlines and sweatshop workers after the stock market crash of 1929 moved Mr. Cohen, 57, who has worked at Smith Barney Asset Management for 30 years, and his wife, an elementary school librarian in Roslyn, to canvas museums, galleries and auctions. 
 Part of the Cohens' vast collection,  104 prints from 89 print makers, is on display through April 19 at the Heckscher Museum in Huntington in ''Visions of a Changing America: Depression Era Prints From the Collection of Herschel and Fern Cohen.'' 
 ''I think there were three periods in this country's history that were unlike any other periods -- the Civil War, the Depression and World War II -- that just changed people's lives forever,'' said Mr. Cohen, who has a Ph.D. in physiological psychology and originally planned to be a college professor. ''Art from the Depression is a window. It's a window into my parents' behavior. It's a window into how people think. I'm so fascinated by how people react to, exist in, come out of periods of unbelievable change and duress.'' 
 The ''rush'' Mr. Cohen feels from finding Depression images, and his obsession with collecting them, stems from his childhood. 
 ''Something about these Depression images, they excited me,'' he said. ''I love images with people. My parents were so Depression driven. They were wonderful people who would never take a risk.'' 
 His father started out in the 1930's selling used records.His mother quit high school to go to work to help support her family. Her father, a manual laborer, shoveled coal and gravel. 
 ''All of our family lived in two-family houses plus attics,'' said Mr. Cohen, a Long Island resident who grew up in Cleveland. ''My grandparents lived upstairs, my aunts and uncles lived next door, my cousins lived in the attic.Everybody pitched in and worked. 
 ''There was one painting in the house and that was by a guy my dad had grown up with. There was no art in the house and no luxuries, period.'' 
 Like many collections, the Cohens'  began accidentally. He knew nothing  about art, she knew very little. While shopping for a rolltop desk, Mr. Cohen stumbled across American paintings in a gallery and bought one instead of a desk. 
 ''It was 1976, the year of the Bicentennial,'' he said. ''There were a lot of celebrations in the museums about American art. My interest was starting to peak and we really flipped for it. The great thing about this country is, even if your parents were immigrants, you kind of take the history of this country as your own. We fell in love with this American art of the 19th century. We made it a mission to go around looking at all this stuff and learning about it. We went to Washington, we started going to regional museums. We went to Vermont, Pennsylvania, all over. We just fell in love with American art.'' 
 As much as the Cohens loved  paintings, especially urban landscapes, they could not afford them. 
 Visiting the National Collection of Fine Arts (now the National Museum of American Art) and the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, the Cohens were drawn to social realist and industrial prints. Twentieth-century renderings by artists like Howard Cook and Louis Lozowick were a natural extension of the Hudson River landscapes they loved. Mr. Cohen began to form a ''wish list.'' 
 Immersing himself in his pursuit, he researched art at the public library and talked to local gallery owners about prints. He bought his  first prints at an auction. 
 ''The prints were really very, very inexpensive, which was perfect,'' he said. ''For someone who came from a background of never spending money on any kind of luxury, I loved this stuff and I didn't feel like I was breaking the bank to do it. Nobody cared. They weren't popular. Especially the kind of stuff I liked. 
 ''I liked the landscapes, but in their stacks I would see an occasional  industrial scene or something with people in it and I loved it. Maybe they  didn't know too much about it. I responded to them and I would buy them. 
 He added: ''I could really decorate a house with them.I had no downside risk. I was always thinking: 'Is this really bad to do? Spend money on this?' I felt that since they were so relatively inexpensive and they were original art, what could my downside risk be? 
 ''I never ever thought of this as investment. Talk about Depression era mentality. I always thought if I lose my job and things get bad and I needed to sell things, could I get something near my money back? It was a luxury. I always worried about security. That came from my parents, and that's a Depression thing.'' 
 Fifteen million people, or almost 25 percent of the work force, were  unemployed during the Depression. Among them were 10,000 artists. Under President Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration, 5,000 artists secured jobs. Among the painters, sculptors and muralists were 300  print makers. 
 The works they produced, made in editions of 25, of which the artist could keep 3, examined the economic crisis around them. Prints of strike scenes and bread lines, tomato pickers and subway riders were distributed to schools, hospitals, libraries and museums. 
 ''The Depression era art would be nonexistent had the Government not sponsored the W.P.A. program,'' said Mary Ryan, owner of a Manhattan gallery specializing in American prints from the 1920's to the present. ''During the height of the Depression, there weren't people buying art,'' she said. ''Some of the greatest artists who worked in the 20th century in America were kept employed by the W.P.A..'' 
 Among Mr. Cohen's favorite images at the Hecksher show is Clare Leighton's ''Bread Line, New York,''  a 1932 wood engraving showing long lines of people hoping for assistance, huddled under the elevated train tracks, a loan shop sign nearby, with the metropolis in the background. 
 In Albert Potter's 1932 linocut, ''Brother Can You Spare a Dime,'' a  man stands, hand outstretched, in front of a throng, while a skeleton hovers above the cityscape. The title was borrowed from the Rudy Vallee and Bing Crosby song, often thought of as the anthem of the Depression. 
 Mabel Dwight's 1935 lithograph, ''Merchants of Death,'' a social commentary reflecting failed capitalism, portrays a skeleton leading a group of businessmen that evolve into vultures. 
 ''Spiderboy,'' a 1936 etching by James Allen, shows a muscular construction worker perched on a steel beam high above the city. This glorified image of a worker reminds Mr. Cohen of his grandfather. 
 Anne Cohen DePietro, curator of  the Hecksher Museum, said that the Depression era collection showed ''America in transition from a rural economy to an industrial economy, from an agrarian-based society to the Industrial Revolution on into the big metropolises that were burgeoning in the 30's.'' 
 ''It documents a period of very exciting transition in America and of great hardship as well as testimony to the resilience of the human spirit,'' she said. Continuing, she said: ''Because they didn't have to worry about finding patrons to purchase  their work, the artists were freed up to explore subjects that they would never have dreamed of having had the freedom to create if they were looking for patrons to buy. It opened the doors creatively.'' 
 Bent and stooped coal miners, covered in soot, trudge home after work, in Michael Gallagher's 1938 etching, ''Scranton Coal Miners.'' Maxine Seelbinder, an obscure print maker, created depressing scenes of tenement life in the 1933 lithograph, ''Housing Needed.'' 
 ''By collecting in that period you can find these treasures that nobody cared about, nobody wanted,'' said Mr. Cohen, admiring one of Seelbinder's images on the wall of his home office. ''There is no information available at any public library  or print book about her. How pessimistic must you be if you only print six of them. She was obviously drawing what she really felt. God, I love this.'' 
 The 30's were also the ''age of urban optimism,'' the era of the skyscraper, elevated trains and industrial architecture. Artists glorified the  machine age and burgeoning steel industry. 
 ''After the W.P.A. program was over, the work that was left was largely destroyed,'' Ms. Ryan said.  ''It was burned and discarded . A lot  of work was used for pipe insulation and as scrap paper for Rikers Island inmates.'' Only a few prints remained. 
 Initially, Depression era art was viewed as a social realistic embarassment, and a reminder of a difficult time, said Ms. Ryan. It wasn't until the 1970's that people began to look at Depression era art anew. Although out of the mainstream of 80's art collecting, burgeoning interest in the last 20 years has dramatically increased their value. 
 In 1981, it was Ms. Ryan, whose gallery specialized in 1930's W.P.A. material, who validated Mr. Cohen's interest in the subset of collecting. 
 ''It was love at first sight,'' Mr.  Cohen said. ''All of a sudden, I found somebody who formally liked the stuff that I had sort of been thinking about but had no information about. I hadn't seen any literature about stuff I liked. She would track down the artists and things I never thought about doing. I finally found someone to share the excitement with, somebody who knew what they were doing.'' 
 Ms. Ryan helped him define why he liked the Depression era art and sought out the same material. He started meeting the few other dealers and collectors around the country who share his passion. 
 The Cohens, who also accumulate doorstops, weathervanes and Americana, hope to keep their collection intact and growing. 
 ''If I'm a collector, it doesn't make me happy that things went up, because there's always something else out there,'' Mr. Cohen said."

 To the Editor: ''Austrians Are Puzzled by Lagging Tourism'' propagates the false notion that Vienna is an expensive place to visit. In recent years, Vienna has consistently been in the middle of the European pack in terms of cost, and in many areas, is well below the average. 
 Take dining out. Your ''$5 pastry,'' an obvious reference to a slice of Sachertorte, with the strong dollar actually costs less than $4. Usually, a Viennese pastry is more like $2.70.

 Chalk up another point for El Nino -- maybe. Portions of Rio's famous beaches, mainly at Copacabana, Ipanema and Leblon, are being nibbled away, and at least some scientists think El Nino is the culprit. 
 David Zee, a coastal engineer and professor of oceanography at Rio's State University, said that about 10 percent of the two-and-a-half-mile Copacabana beach had shrunk in width by 100 to 150 feet, and in Ipanema a 985-foot section of Arpoador beach has lost more than half of its 100 feet of sandy width. 
 Beach erosion happens regularly during El Nino, the cyclical weather pattern, said Prakki Satymurty, chief of operations at the National Institute for Space Research. But the erosion of Rio's beaches may have started even before El Nino, according to Marcio Luis Vianna, an oceanographer at the National Institute for Space Research, and may have more to do with a gradual intensification of South Atlantic winds in recent years, bringing higher and heavier waves. 
 Mauricio Tostes Vieira, Secretary of Works for the city government, said that his office was observing the situation. ''But if necessary,'' he said, ''we will do a landfill.''

"268","Young Paul Strand: Impressionable, Experimental",1003435,"|arts",20,3,1998,"19980320T000000",NA," 
 Was there ever a time in American art when so many conflicting impulses and imperatives converged as in the first two decades of this century? 
 Victorian sentimentality bumped into social reform, which in turn came up against the formalist revolutions of the European avant-garde. No wonder young artists of the period were either exhilarated or confused, or a little bit of both. 
 Among those exhilarated was the photographer Paul Strand (1890-1976), whose early work is the subject of a thought-provoking exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Organized by Maria Morris Hambourg, curator of photography at the Met, ''Paul Strand Circa 1916'' brings together some 60 pictures made between 1911, when the artist was barely past his student years, and 1917. 
 Strand was in every way a product of his complex time. Born and reared on Manhattan's Upper West Side, the child of a comfortable Jewish family, he was sent to the Ethical Culture School for an education that gave equal weight to individual creativity and social engagement. 
 His high school art teacher was no less a figure than the great documentary photographer and sociologist Lewis Hine. And it was Hine who took Strand on a class trip to the Fifth Avenue gallery of Alfred Stieglitz, where the tradition-shattering art of modernist Europe would within a few years find an American home. 
 At the time of Strand's visit in 1907, however, Stieglitz's interests still lay elsewhere. He was championing the photographic movement known as Pictorialism, in which the painterly treatment of prints and the use of poetic subjects were seen as ways to establish photography's status as a high-art medium. 
 Several of the photographers Stieglitz favored -- Clarence White, Edward Steichen, Gertrude Kasebier, Alvin Langdon Coburn, George H. Seeley and Adolph de Meyer, among them -- are included in a small exhibition at the Met titled ''Pictorialism in New York, 1900-1915,'' which was organized by Laura Muir and serves as a prologue to the Strand show. And from work like White's familiar ''Morning'' (1898), with its white-robed woman wandering, crystal ball in hand, through a mist to de Meyer's gauzy society portraits, the movement's attractions as well as its deeply conservative inclinations are clear. 
 Strand experimented with the style. Among the first works in the Met show is his 1910 picture of a grove of trees filtered through a kind of palpitating tonal haze. But it was Stieglitz himself, with ideas about art much changed in the wake of the revolutionary Armory Show of 1913, who in 1915 steered the young artist toward ''straight photography,'' involving minimal handwork and real-life subjects. 
 Strand took his mentor's advice seriously, but selectively (he continued to manipulate his prints). And a trip across the United States that year produced an extraordinary mix of images. His picture of the classical pillars of the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco harked back to an idealizing style. A shot of telegraph poles leaning across a bleak Texas landscape was something new. In an unsystematic way, Strand was juggling the influence of Stieglitz and Hine, and it was this blend of approaches that he brought back to New York. 
 They merge in one of his most famous pictures, ''Wall Street'' (1915), a shot of lower Manhattan office workers walking to their jobs and dwarfed by the then-new J. P. Morgan building. On the one hand, the picture's play of geometric forms is a brilliant exercise in formal calculation. On the other, the colossal scale and unanswering darkness of the building's windows suggest the crushing corporate power that lay within. 
 Both of these components, the esthetic and the social, interweave, sometimes deliberately, sometimes serendipitously, in much of Strand's youthful work. And then they separate out, as they seem to have done during the summer of 1916, which he spent at his family's house in Twin Lakes, Conn. 
 In this bucolic setting, Strand applied some of the monumentality of his Manhattan photos to domestic objects, turning glazed mixing bowls and Cezannesque apples and pears into Cubistic still lifes carved from shadow and light. Even more radically, he shot patterns of sunlight streaming through chair slats and porch railings, to create entirely abstract photographs, the first of their kind intended as such. Finally, he tilted his camera skyward to catch, at a vertiginous angle, the corner of a porch roof sailing against a sea of moving clouds. 
 This rapturous, inebriate vision, so simple and so liberating, can best be understood as part of the conceptual free fall that European modernism inspired. In his sky pictures, Strand is looking at ''nothing,'' but his decision to look at it and then to award it photographic attention is what's important. It makes the fact of attention itself, with its mix of accident and choice, an important component of art, as Marcel Duchamp and other progressive artists realized. 
 But progressive is a tricky idea. What constitutes advanced thinking in art and advanced thinking in life are by no means always the same thing. It is possible, in fact, to regard Strand's Twin Lakes photographs, formally daring as they are, as updated extensions of Pictorialism's hothouse escapist esthetic. 
 Maybe Strand, to some degree, thought so, for in the same year he produced a series of urban portraits clearly influenced by his first teacher, Lewis Hine. 
 Hine, who spent years photographing immigrants on Ellis Island, saw his own work not as muckraking reform journalism but as a form of social propaganda shaping, through art, a record of what John Dewey called America's ''moral democracy.'' 
 Strand's street photos of 1916, taken with a special camera designed to capture his subjects unawares, emulate Hines's engaged stance. He focused on the city's rich cultural mix (two Orthodox Jewish men deep in conversation; an elderly woman with a time-creased face sitting in Washington Square Park). But he also portrayed its dispossessed, as in the picture of a disheveled woman giving a spectacular yawn and a man with dazed eyes seen in the Irish slum neighborhood in lower Manhattan known as the Five Points. 
 Did the immediacy of these living subjects unnerve Strand, even scare him? The human figure would become a central theme of his career, though increasingly he presented it carefully posed and expressively distanced, transformed -- despite a veneer of sociological frankness -- into a still life. 
 Interestingly, the final entries in the Met show suggest a retreat, however temporary, into the controlled realm of formalism and abstraction. The photographs from 1917 are almost entirely tightly framed close-ups of automobiles and repeated overhead shots of the empty, walled backyard of the artist's Upper West Side family home. 
 When he made these pictures, there was good reason to seek comfort in the familiar. The country had been sucked into World War I, and Strand was drafted for service. By the time he was discharged two years later, the era of sky's-the-limit optimism was gone, and New York's artistic avant-garde had more or less dispersed. 
 Strand still had a long career of films and books ahead of him. But his early pictures are special. Political art and formalism are usually taken to be either-or propositions. In America at the beginning of this century, as in Russia later, attempts were made to unite them: to frame the social subject, however humble, in a language of advanced visual ideas. It was a quixotic goal, both admirable and foolhardy. But ''Paul Strand Circa 1916'' tells the story, beautifully, of one artist finding that subject, learning that language, and every now and then persuading them to meet. 
 ''Paul Strand Circa 1916'' and ''Pictorialism in New York, 1900-1915'' remain at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, through May 31. ''Paul Strand Circa 1916'' travels to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (June 19-Sept. 15).  PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW"
"269","A Psychological Biography of a Dancer Gone Mad",1008618,"|movies|arts",10,4,1998,"19980410T000000",NA," 
 A ballet world in search of a major choreographer need search no more. He is Boris Eifman, a 52-year-old Russian whose Eifman Ballet from St. Petersburg made its New York debut on Wednesday night at City Center with his ''Red Giselle.'' 
 A word of caution. Mr. Eifman's take on the well-known mental illness of the emigre Russian ballerina Olga Spessivtseva (she died in 1991 in New York State) requires some suspension of disbelief. 
 Once past the cartoonish simplicities of his scenario, the complexities and blazing invention of his choreography, as performed by a stunning group of passionate dancers, are never in doubt. ''Red Giselle'' may not persuade but it will not bore. It is a highly dramatic and theatrical (the two are not the same) work, a perfected form of narrative ballet for which others in the West have strived. 
 Mr. Eifman could be called the rich man's Kenneth MacMillan, with some Roland Petit thrown in. The two United States premieres that his company is to present through Sunday night at City Center (131 West 55th Street) are the kind of psychological biographies that have interested such Western choreographers. MacMillan's ''Isadora'' for the Royal Ballet and ''Anastasia'' come to mind immediately. 
 ''Red Giselle,'' which has an alternating cast, and ''Tchaikovsky,'' which is to have its premiere tomorrow, have a similar anti-Romantic toughness. Not everything is beautiful at the ballet in such works, and their lack of uplift would not have endeared Mr. Eifman to the Soviet authorities. 
 He was, in fact, Soviet choreography's least well-kept secret. Born in Siberia, where his family was exiled, and trained in Kishinev, Moldavia, and in the choreography department of the Leningrad Conservatory, Mr. Eifman quickly showed a brilliant talent that was too big to ignore. A film of his ballet ''Gayane'' with the Riga Ballet, shown in New York in 1979, immediately caught one's attention. Here was real choreography, and free of Soviet cliches, classical steps forced into an expressiveness for which they were not suited. 
 Mr. Eifman's gift is to wed gesture and classical technique into seamless expression. He is his own man, an original. 
 Unfortunately, the story line of ''Red Giselle,'' no matter how sincere, is Manichean rubbish. In short, we are told that Spessivtseva went mad because of the Russian Revolution and betrayals in love. Her first admirer here is an official in the secret police (actually Boris Kaplun) and the second is identified as her Partner, actually Serge Lifar, who preferred men and who himself was preferred by Serge Diaghilev, founder of the Ballets Russes. 
 But who is to know why Spessivtseva became ill? She entered a mental hospital in New York City in 1940 after dancing for the last time in 1937. Earlier, she had performed with Diaghilev and the Maryinsky Ballet. Millions who did not go mad had also survived the Russian Revolution, the emigre experience and love gone wrong. 
 Like MacMillan, who seemed influenced by Ken Russell's sensationalist biographical films, Mr. Eifman is entitled to artistic license. ''Red Giselle'' is at its best when it is at its most hallucinatory. 
 But images reduced to obvious contrast do not tell us much we do not know. On one hand, there is the enclosed world of the Imperial Ballet. The dancers take class in knee-length tutus and perform in the gold costumes that set off the blue of the Maryinsky theater. On the other side, there is the coarseness of the elbow-swinging, stamping revolutionary mob that invades the theater and the leather-clad Secret Police Agent, as he is called, who brutalizes the ballerina in a series of sexually tinged acrobatic duets. 
 Nor can one believe that Lifar led her astray. Here again tragedy is reduced to a scene in which her Partner, as Lifar is called, pays attention to a male dancer. 
 Yet when that caress by Lifar is repeated in a clever gloss on Act I of ''Giselle,'' Mr. Eifman's conception coalesces with dramatic force. For if Spessivtseva lives in legend today, it is because she has become universally identified with her most famous role: Giselle, the peasant girl who goes mad after Albrecht, her aristocratic lover, betrays her. 
 One might suppress a laugh when Lifar's Albrecht here caresses Wilfrid, his squire. But this fleeting image, working on two levels, sets the scene for the blurring of fantasy and reality that gives ''Red Giselle'' its powerful ending. 
 Before Giselle emerges from a plastic bubble (the dome of the Paris Opera) and retreats into a world of mirrors, she traverses a lifetime of stunning scene changes designed by Vyacheslav Okunev and moves through a musical journey that begins with Tchaikovsky and ends with Alfred Schnittke. 
 Yelena Kuzmina, in the title role, is an impressive dancer with an amazing flexible back. In her duets with her ballet teacher, Aleksandr Utkin, the Secret Police Agent, Albert Galichanin, and the Partner, Igor Markov, she does amazing things. 
 Mr. Eifman's choreography contrasts floor work and lifts, spirals and slides, the erotic and the pure. The entire company, with Russian fluidity, shifts easily from classical line to its distortion. We know the heroine is in trouble when her line is broken into angles and she flexes her feet. 
 The duets stand out but Mr. Eifman is equally at home in group choreography. Notice his stylization of the Charleston in Act II. 
 Mr. Markov, dancing also with Sergei Zimin, epitomizes the lithe athleticism of the men in the company. Mr. Utkin is nimble as the teacher tormented by the booted Secret Police who later partner his ballerinas. Mr. Galichanin, expressing powerful angst of his own, expertly partners Ms. Kuzmina through the choreography's twists and back flips. Sometimes a puppet dangling on his arm or sometimes in ecstasy, Ms. Kuzmina conveys the ambiguity of her character. 
 The hallucinations of Act II work precisely because they are so provocative. The Secret Police Agent's head seems to float in the air when his body is concealed by a curtain. The heroine is entrapped by other ghosts, the spirits or wilis who inhabit the shrewd digest of ''Giselle.'' Life and art come together. 
 Give Mr. Eifman another subject and any Western ballet company would be fortunate to acquire him as a guest.

 Reports of serious crime fell across the nation in 1997, the sixth consecutive annual decrease, with the biggest drop in the Northeastern states and in big cities, the Justice Department said today. 
 Preliminary figures released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which collected them from 16,000 city, county and state law-enforcement agencies, showed that the overall rate of serious crime fell 4 percent, accelerating the decline of recent years. 
 Violent crimes declined by 5 percent, led by 9 percent decreases in murders and robberies. There were smaller decreases in the categories of aggravated assault, down 2 percent, and rape, down 1 percent. 
 Rape was the one type of crime for which the statistics showed less progress. Reported rapes declined 2 percent in 1996, 5 percent in 1995, and 4 percent in 1994. 
 Property crimes declined by 4 percent, led by an 8 percent drop in arson. Car thefts fell 5 percent. 
 The Northeastern states led the decline in virtually every category. Murders in the region declined 13 percent, total violent crimes declined 5 percent and property crimes declined 6 percent. 
 Experts have said several trends were contributing to the declining pace of crime. Among them were the aging of the population, a toughening of sentencing laws and the increasing numbers of people in prison. The healthy economy was also a factor, experts said. 
 Cities with populations over a million reported that murders and robberies each declined 11 percent. Cities with populations of half a million to a million reported murders and robberies each down 10 percent. Cities with populations of a quarter of a million to half a million reported murders down 14 percent and robberies down 10 percent. 
 In New York City, the total number of crimes counted in the report declined 7 percent, to 355,893 in 1997 from 382,555 in 1996. Murders declined 22 percent, to 770 from 983, and robberies dropped 10 percent, to 44,707 from 49,672. The number of reported rapes in New York City fell to 2,157 from 2,332."

 To the Editor: 
 Robert E. Hall (''Antitrust Excess?'', Op-Ed, May 20) too hastily concludes that the antitrust suit against Microsoft may not benefit consumers. 
 He neglects the possibility that Microsoft's tie-in of its Web browser is a means of preserving its monopoly on operating systems. 
 Windows has maintained its high market share in part because it supports more software applications than any potential rival. But competing browsers like Netscape can act as alternative ''platforms'' to which applications can be written. Consumers could soon choose an operating system other than Windows and still have access to a wide range of software.

"272","Sports of The Times; Venus's Mom Delivers Hard Truth",1021761,"|sports",3,6,1998,"19980603T000000",NA," 
 IN theory, this was the match that might have nudged Martina Hingis closer to accepting Venus Williams as a rival. It turned out to be the match that forced Williams to accept Hingis as a role model. 
 ''Some people are willing to make sacrifices,'' Williams said after her 6-3, 6-4 drubbing in the French Open. ''The top players do it. I'm not there. She's probably doing it.'' The result brought out a trace of humility from Williams, downright touching from any teen-ager, much less a teen-age millionaire athlete. 
 ''I think I didn't play as well as I should have,'' Williams volunteered in her interview after the match. ''I think she played better.'' 
 This is high respect indeed for a player who exists in her own private Compton with her sister and her parents, who all seem to feel that every tournament is Williams versus World. The inner focus has helped Venus become the seventh-ranked female player in the world, but it may have dawned on her yesterday that the top-ranked player with the fixed smile may also have inner focus, plus strokes, plus a game plan. 
 And if Williams missed the point, she had somebody willing to deliver it to her, right after the match. The messenger was her mother, Oracene, who now serves as coach. As she left the court, Venus displayed a wide smile that seemed to bespeak embarrassment. She later described her body language to her mother and sister as a visual version of ''Dude.'' Her mother may not have been so casual when they met in the locker room. 
 ''We talked about it,'' Venus admitted. ''I don't need somebody soft to pet you, to say you tried. It's true. I didn't try hard enough. Now I'd like to try the right thing.'' 
 Would Venus have liked her mother to whisper some soft things to her? ''I'm too old for petting,'' she said. ''I just need the truth.'' 
 The truth was that Hingis outplayed Williams, despite the Williams service cannonades that are now rocketing into the guy-stuff 120-mile-an-hour range. 
 The world is waiting for the next great female rivalry, maybe something like Evert and that other Martina back in the old days. A renovated Monica Seles is back in this Grand Slam semifinal after the long ordeal of her father's terminal illness, but Steffi Graf is dropping out of the computer ranking and, presumably, out of tennis. There is time for a great rivalry that might stick into the next millennium. Williams is two weeks shy of 18 and Hingis is three months shy of 18, and they walk around each other with the sense that they -- and we -- will be counting the notches on their pistols for years to come. Right now it's six for Hingis and two for Williams, the last two on clay. 
 ''She grew up on clay,'' Williams said. ''I grew up on hard courts. She probably plays better here. I've only played three times on clay.'' 
 It showed, as Williams sometimes hit off the wrong foot, or with her long legs splayed, even once playing a lob off her backhand, but some of the confusion could be allayed to the winds. 
 ''You have to change your strategy,'' Hingis said. ''Today I did it better than her.'' 
 All great athletes become control freaks, and these two indulged in personal forms of gamesmanship -- Hingis complained of bad calls (she won three of four inspections of alleged ball marks by the chair umpire), Williams dashed to the players' bathroom just when Hingis was about to serve for the match. 
 This is a trend, following the demand for a break from Anna Kournikova earlier in this tournament, but Williams was not claiming a natural urgency for the quick rush. She said she had to change clothing because she had fallen in the previous game. 
 ''I was dirty,'' she said. ''I don't like to appear that way. I had to change my skirt.'' 
 Hingis was pretty sanguine about the break, perhaps because she has taken a strategic walk in her time -- two during her upset to Iva Majoli on these very grounds last year. 
 ''When somebody takes a break, it usually helps me,'' Hingis explained later. ''She had to walk there. It made her tired.'' 
 Right. But when Hingis takes a walk, that is the right move to collect her wits. She has the ability to want it both ways, which most champions learn at an early age. Williams, who has been competitive and quick-witted in her short professional career, is now getting a glimpse of the higher education needed to turn this into a real rivalry."
"273","Why Must Farms Use Migrant Labor?",1021861,"|opinion",3,6,1998,"19980603T000000",NA," 
 To the Editor: 
 Re your May 31 front-page article on migrant farm workers: The inhuman living conditions of many migrant farm workers result from the distorted supply of labor to United States farms. Many Americans cannot afford to accept the low wages offered by agricultural employers because they would have to forfeit their social welfare benefits. This creates a surplus of impoverished farm laborers, many of whom are illegal immigrants. 
 To attract more citizens to low-paying jobs like farm labor, income above the poverty level has to be assured. The Government should cash out its narrowly defined corporate and social welfare programs and redirect that money to every American in an annual tax rebate that, when added to the minimum wage, would bring every worker above the poverty level.

 One of the more annoying aspects of mainstream news coverage of the ''gay conversion'' issue, including your Aug. 13 profile of Janet L. Folger, the architect of the recent ''ex-gay'' advertising campaign, is the implied opposition between Christians on the one hand and lesbians and gay men on the other. 
 In fact, there are many self-affirming lesbian and gay Christians -- and many nongay Christians who support gay Christians' struggle to gain acceptance with their church communities. Organization of lesbian and gay Christians, including the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches and the lesbian and gay caucuses that exist in every mainline Protestant denomination, constitute the most long-lived and numerically strongest sector of the lesbian and gay liberation movement.

"279","How To Tame Your Pushy Zucchini: Make Soup",1040097,"|dining|wine|style",19,8,1998,"19980819T000000",NA," 
 ZUCCHINI is the vegetable that doesn't know when to stop. A backyard zucchini crop at this time of year can grow from merely abundant to brazen, overtaking the garden and leaving the gardener with more zucchini than anyone could ever need. 
 But it is not necessary to resort to sneaking out in the dead of night and leaving baskets of the stuff anonymously on an unwary neighbor's doorstep. This is a problem that calls for a creative solution, and that solution is called soup. 
 As I have been working with soups lately, I have found that there are many pleasant alternatives to stock for the base, and some of these take advantage of produce that is abundant right now. Bases made from watery vegetables, like tomatoes, cucumber and zucchini, have fresh, attractive flavors, along with the added benefit of making our vegetarian friends very happy. These bases can be made now when the vegetables are plentiful and inexpensive, and they can then be frozen, if desired. 
 Making the zucchini puree soup base requires a minimal amount of cooking on a hot, late summer day: just saute the zucchini until it is tender, and then puree it. 
 Made with unpeeled zucchini, the puree and the soups it is added to will have more color and intense flavor, with a slight, pleasant hint of bitterness. Made with peeled zucchini, the base and soups will be paler and milder. 
 Somewhere between a salad and a soup is zucchini gazpacho, cool and refreshing. For the fullest flavor, chill the gazpacho overnight, and then add strips of another summer favorite, basil, on top just before serving it. 
 Chilled zucchini and parsley soup is ridiculously easy to make and low in calories. Vegetarians should note, however, that this recipe does use chicken stock, which gives the soup a fuller flavor. Low-fat cottage cheese adds just a bit of creamy texture to the soup, and hot pepper sauce provides some zip. 
 And though no one wants to think of winter right now, keep the zucchini puree in mind as the base for heartier cold-weather soups in the months to come. Two of my favorites are a soothing cabbage soup and a minestrone that warms the soul. 
 By the time I make these soups, concerns about an overflowing zucchini garden will be long gone, and the vegetable's aroma will conjure up only pleasant memories of these summer days. 
 ZUCCHINI PUREE SOUP BASE  Time: 1 hour 
 2 tablespoons butter or olive oil (see note) 
 3 pounds medium zucchini, peeled or unpeeled, quartered lengthwise and cut across into  1/2-inch pieces.

"281","Gillette to Cut Jobs by 11% As Results Lag",1050193,"|business",29,9,1998,"19980929T000000",NA," 
 Warning that its third-quarter results would be dismal, the Gillette Company said yesterday that it would cut 4,700 jobs, or 11 percent of its worldwide work force, as it reorganized its business. 
 The company, the world's largest maker of blades and razors, said earnings for the quarter would be down 20 percent from the quarter a year ago, largely as a result of a $535 million charge against earnings to pay for the cutbacks and reorganization. 
 Analysts said they were surprised by how bleak the earnings outlook was. Gillette was expected to earn 40 cents a share in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, based on a consensus of analysts polled by First Call, an investment research company, compared with 38 cents a share, adjusted for a stock split, a year earlier. Gillette also said it expected to report a decline of 6 percent to 7 percent in revenue for the quarter, from $2.4 billion a year ago. 
 Gillette plans to close 14 plants and 12 warehouses and eliminate or consolidate about 30 office facilities worldwide. The company, which is based in Boston, did not say which plants and offices would be closed. The cost cuts, which are part of the company's second reorganization in five years, will result in annual savings of more than $200 million, with a third of that coming next year and the balance by 2001. 
 The company also said its earnings would grow by the ''low double digits'' in the fourth quarter, but it had expected to earn 41 cents a share, based on the First Call consensus. 
 Gillette announced the profit warning and the cutbacks after the stock market closed. Earlier, its shares rose $1.6875, to $40, on the New York Stock Exchange. Third-quarter results are scheduled to be released on Oct. 15. 
 Calling it a ''very poor quarter we'd like to forget,'' Alfred M. Zeien, the chairman and chief executive officer of the company, said the results could be attributed to several factors. First, the company's strategy to accelerate the introduction its new Mach 3 shaving system resulted in huge one-time costs. At the same time, Mr. Zeien said, consumers have been stocking up on the new razor, which was sold with at least a month's worth of blades, and many have not yet had to purchase replacements. In addition, economic instability in some countries has hurt wholesale demand overseas. 
 In a conference call with financial analysts yesterday, Mr. Zeien sought to assure investors that the fundamentals of Gillette's business remained strong and that the Mach 3 shaver was meeting sales expectations. He also assured analysts that the reorganization would bring about a more competitive company. 
 The changes, Mr. Zeien said, ''will allow Gillette to become a more cost-effective competitor, help Gillette to achieve its aggressive strategic plans, recapture the sales and earnings growth momentum and enhance the company's ability to improve shareholder return.'' 
 But the assurances did little to pacify analysts, who said they had not been expecting an earnings drop of as much as 20 percent and had little warning from Gillette's management that estimates were so far off target. 
 ''There has been a lack of information over the last quarter,'' said William Steele, who follows the company for Buckingham Research. ''Basically I think investors have been too optimistic based upon the company's guidance.'' 
 In addition to the job cuts and factory closings, Gillette said it was realigning its management. The company, which manufactures the best-selling Sensor razor line as well as Duracell batteries and Oral B dental products, said its six global business management units would be organized under two executive vice presidents. In addition, the consolidation of the commercial operations will result in five geographic groups organized under two additional executive vice presidents. 
 The groups will sell the company's entire product line within their geographic territories instead of having distinct selling organizations with separate administrative functions in one territory. The four executive vice presidents will report to Michael C. Hawley, president and chief operating officer. 
 ''Under the new organization structure, there will be one Gillette Company in each of the major geographic regions,'' Mr. Hawley said."
"282","THE MARKETS: Market Place; Help wanted: Electronic Data Systems and Nike have been seeking finance chiefs for months.",1063571,"|business",20,11,1998,"19981120T000000",NA," 
 A COMPANY that goes for some time without a chief financial officer may be raising a red flag for investors. 
 The average search for a chief financial officer takes three to four months, according to Lee Pomeroy a consultant at Egon Zehnder International, an executive search firm. A quest that drags on longer than that can indicate that things are ''structurally wrong'' within the company, he said. 
 Candidates for a corporation's top financial job, of course, may balk for any number of reasons. They may be dissatisfied with the compensation, the degree of authority or the chain of command. But sometimes the issues are ones that also concern investors: management's corporate strategy, the abilities of the chief executive or the strength of the company's business. 
 That's why some analysts have been looking somewhat warily at Electronic Data Systems and Nike, two companies that have been without chief financial officers for more than seven months. 
 Both companies have struggled as the global financial turmoil saps their revenues, and the price of both their stocks have suffered. 
 Shares of Electronic Data, also known as E.D.S., are down more than 11 percent for the year. Yesterday, they closed at $38.9375, down 31.25 cents. Class B shares of Nike are up 7 percent for the year, but down more than 20 percent since July. They closed at $41.8125 yesterday, up 43.75 cents. 
 E.D.S. says its search for a finance chief has been put on hold until a new chief executive is found. Nike is now on its second search firm for a chief financial officer. 
 While business slowdowns are investors' primary concern, the continued absence of finance chiefs does not help foster confidence in the two companies, analysts said. 
 Greg Gieber, senior equity analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman, said that E.D.S. needed stronger internal financial controls and a finance chief who would enact them quickly. That, he said, would enable the company to improve its ability to forecast earnings. 
 ''Some of the earnings surprises were surprises to senior management as well,'' Mr. Gieber said. ''One thing I want to hear a C.F.O. saying is, 'We now have our internal reporting structure under control.' '' 
 Such comments reflect the rising importance of chief financial officers as their role has grown in recent years: they help orchestrate turnarounds of troubled companies, identify and negotiate mergers and acquisitions and plan spinoffs. 
 ''The chief financial officer is the second most important person'' in a company, said Randall S. Peterson, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management. 
 The chief executive is primarily responsible for setting a company's strategic direction, but the chief financial officer is usually responsible for the day-to-day financial activities and can play a major role in communicating corporate strategies and progress to shareholders, said Stephen Gates, a principal researcher for the Conference Board. 
 Indeed, a Conference Board study of the stock performance of 300 companies in the last three years found that companies whose shares outperformed those of their rivals usually had a chief financial officer who spent more than 20 percent of his or her time assisting executives with forming business strategies. 
 Deborah C. Hopkins, who was named as the new chief financial officer at the Boeing Company on Monday, is a good example of the type of finance chief many companies now seek. 
 Ms. Hopkins, formerly the finance chief of European operations for the General Motors Corporation, has overseen risk-management programs and developed programs that aided G.M.'s international growth. Prior to that, she helped turn around the troubled Unisys Corporation. Before Boeing's announcement, Ms. Hopkins had been considered a top candidate to fill the post at E.D.S. 
 As demand for top finance executives rises, so does their compensation. Last year, the average compensation of chief financial officers, including the value of stock options, rose to more than $4 million, up 83 percent from the previous year. 
 The star power of some finance chiefs is sometimes illustrated by how the market reacts to their departures or arrivals. Jerome B. York earned such a strong reputation for his cost-cutting ways as chief financial officer of I.B.M. that when he left in September 1995, the company's shares tumbled nearly 2 percent in a session during which other computer stocks rose. 
 In the case of Nike, the world's largest athletic footwear company, Robert Falcone, who had held the post for six years, resigned in January. Nike has suffered from declining sales in the United States and abroad. Hiring a chief financial officer, analysts say, could indicate that Nike is serious about making changes and improving its profitability. 
 ''It's a crucial role, especially in a turnaround,'' Faye Landes, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said. 
 For example, Nike's expenses and inventory controls might get more attention from a chief financial officer. ''Many people would like Nike to take a very strong look at expenses,'' she said. ''The company has always been able to grow into expenses, but it's dealing with a much smaller growth rate.'' 
 Many of Nike's problems in recent months can be traced to swollen inventory, caused by a sales slowdown in Asia and waning popularity of some styles. 
 ''It might also be prudent for the company to look at how it forecasts,'' Ms. Landes said. ''They forecast better than anybody in the industry, but it might not be good enough.'' 
 Jeff Cava, Nike's vice president for global human resources, conceded that the search had ''certainly taken longer than we had hoped.'' 
 He said that Nike had had the greatest difficulty in attracting candidates whose families were willing to relocate to its corporate headquarters in Beaverton, Ore. 
 ''We're a special company with a special culture and fit is as important as the technical qualifications,'' Mr. Cava said. ''Our process is probably a little more rigorous.'' 
 Correction:  November 21, 1998, Saturday  The Market Place column in Business Day yesterday, about companies that have not filled the post of chief financial officer in many months, misstated the reason for a recent slowdown at one such company, the Electronic Data Systems Corporation. Its earnings have suffered from cost-cutting by customers, particularly the General Motors Corporation, not from the global financial turmoil."

 To the Editor: 
 Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee apparently found the only two people in the United States who have been convicted for lying about consensual sex in a civil case (news article, Dec. 2). Thousands of divorce-case perjurers, for example, are never prosecuted for lying about consensual sex. 
 Of the two found prosecutions for consensual-sex perjury, one  of the two cases should not even count. 
 When a psychiatrist has sex with a psychiatric patient, that is closer to rape than consensual sex because the patient may well lack the mental capacity to consent. The President should be impeached only for routinely prosecuted or prosecutable crimes. Lying about consensual sex is neither.

"285","Police Officer Is Charged With Murder In Connecticut",1078689,"|new york|region",20,1,1999,"19990120T000000","|New Milford (Conn)"," 
 A police officer in New Milford, Conn., turned himself in to the State Police yesterday after being charged with murder in the shooting death of an unarmed suspect last month. 
 The officer, Scott B. Smith, 27, of New Milford is charged with killing Franklyn Reid, also 27 and from New Milford, about 11 A.M. on Dec. 29. 
 According to investigators with the State Attorney's Office in Waterbury, Officer Smith used excessive force and shot Mr. Reid in the back, just below the neck, while he was on his knees after a foot chase. 
 The investigators' report, which was released on Monday, said that Mr. Reid suffered a contact wound, indicating that the gun was pressed against his back, ''or close to it,''  State Attorney John A. Connelly said. 
 Mr. Reid, a felon with a record that included convictions for assault and sexual assault, was wanted on  charges including violating probation, six counts of telephone harassment and three charges of failure to appear in court. 
 Officer Smith and his partner, David Shortt, were backing up another officer who had been pursuing Mr. Reid when they spotted the suspect at a New Milford gas station. Mr. Reid then ran away and Officer Smith chased him on foot. 
 Officer Smith told investigators that after he caught Mr. Reid and forced him to his knees, he did not see the suspect's hands, and that Mr. Reid made a quick move. 
 ''I believed at the time he was either going to shoot me or stab me,'' he said. ''Out of fear for my life at that instant, I discharged my weapon one time, striking Mr. Reid.'' 
 Officer Smith, who has been on the police force in New Milford for about two years, surrendered in Litchfield, Conn. He was arraigned in Superior Court in Bantam, Conn., and released  after posting a $250,000 bond. 
 Mr. Connelly said he believed that Officer Smith was the first Connecticut police officer charged with murder for a killing that occurred while on duty. If convicted, he would receive a mandatory sentence of 25 years to life in prison. 
 Officer Smith's lawyer, Thomas J. Allingham of New Milford, said his client would hold a news conference Friday in Litchfield. 
 Officer Smith is also the target of a civil rights wrongful death lawsuit filed last week in United States District Court in Bridgeport by Mr. Reid's family. The lawyer for the family, Richard Bieder of Bridgeport, did not return a telephone call seeking comment yesterday. 
 The shooting has raised questions of racial bias, since Mr. Reid was black and Officer Smith is white. New Milford has a population of about 27,000, and less than one percent, about 200 people, are black. Neither Mayor Art Pietler nor James D. Sweeney, chief of the 42-member Police Department, returned calls yesterday seeking comments about the killing. But Mr. Allingham said, ''Race didn't have anything to do with this event.''"

"289","Sports of The Times; Richman's Love-In With the Game",1083427,"|sports",7,2,1999,"19990207T000000",NA," 
 WHEN the premiere of the official 1998 World Series video ended not long ago and the lights went on, Joe Torre turned toward a balding, bespectacled man in the back of the room. 
 ''I love you, Arthur Richman,'' the Yankee manager said. 
 Joe Torre's banker, along with George Steinbrenner and every Yankee fan, should love Arthur Richman, too. And all that love will hug Richman at the New York Baseball Writers Dinner tonight when he is honored with the William J. Slocum Award for long and meritorious service. 
 The 72-year-old Richman, once a sportswriter with The Daily Mirror and a Mets executive for nearly three decades, is now a senior adviser in the Yankee hierarchy. 
 ''George Steinbrenner and I fight all the time,'' he was saying, surrounded by more than a hundred photos on the walls of his Yankee Stadium office. ''An hour later, we go out to dinner together.'' 
 But when the Yankees needed a new manager for the 1996 season, they didn't fight. Instead, Steinbrenner asked Richman to recommend replacements for Buck Showalter. 
 ''George told me, 'Make me up a list,' '' Richman recalled. 
 His list had four names: Tony La Russa, Davey Johnson, Sparky Anderson and Torre. But La Russa was about to sign a $1.5 million contract with the St. Louis Cardinals, Johnson was about to be hired as the Baltimore Orioles' manager, and Anderson was content in retirement in California. 
 ''George interviewed Joe for the general manager's job, but Joe didn't want it,'' Richman said. ''I told George that Joe really would prefer to manage.'' 
 When the Yankees announced Torre as the new dugout manager, skeptics pounced. One tabloid headline described him as Clueless Joe. In 14 seasons as a manager with the Mets, the Atlanta Braves and the Cardinals, Torre had had only one first-place team. 
 ''When George saw the papers, he asked me, 'Do you know what you're doing?' '' Richman said. ''I told him, 'If I don't, fire me.' '' 
 Richman knew Torre with the Mets for five years, when Richman was the traveling secretary and Torre was the manager. He knew Torre as a New Yorker from Brooklyn who understood New York. He knew that Torre's quiet toughness wouldn't wilt under Steinbrenner's tyranny. And with two World Series rings in three seasons, Torre has fulfilled Richman's faith. 
 ''Joe should love me,'' Richman said with a laugh. ''He's going to be making $2 million this year. Whenever he stops managing, he'll never have to work again.'' 
 Richman would tell you that he has never really worked at all, dating to 1942 when he was hired as a copy boy by The Daily Mirror's legendary sports editor, Dan Parker. 
 ''Who else would work for $11.88 a week when older guys were making $90 a week in war plants?'' he said. ''But when Dan Parker hired me, that started my whole life.'' 
 It's been a long and meritorious life shared for decades with his late brother, Milton, a renowned sportswriter with United Press International; with his wife, Martha, since 1979; and with thousands of baseball people, notably Don Larsen, the Yankee right-hander who pitched a perfect game in the 1956 World Series. 
 ''I hung out with Donnie then,'' he said. ''Everybody thinks he was drunk the night before, but we just went to Billy Taylor's bar on West 57th Street, had a few toddies and went back to the Grand Concourse Hotel, where he was living. He went out for a pizza, came back and told me, 'I might pitch a no-hitter tomorrow.' '' 
 When Larsen was married, Richman was his best man. And when Richman was married, his best man was Willie Mays. 
 ''Several other guys stood up for me, too,'' Richman said. ''Ernie Banks, Ralph Kiner, Joe Torre, Dick Williams, Lee Mazzilli, Joe Pignatano, Ted Sizemore and Doug Flynn.'' 
 Richman joined the Yankees in 1989 as a vice president of media relations, a job that, in the Steinbrenner regime, had never been known for its longevity. But he's still there. 
 ''I've been fired 15 times and I've quit 20 times,'' Richman said with a laugh. ''George will see me and say, 'I thought you left,' and I'll tell him, 'How can I leave?' George gets on me for having a toddy now and then, but I tell him, 'My doctors told me I have to drink to relieve the stress that you cause me.' '' 
 For all his Yankee loyalty now, Richman hasn't forgotten his first baseball love: the St. Louis Browns of the early 1940's. 
 ''As a Bronx kid hanging around the Stadium, I'd see the Yankee players come down from the Grand Concourse Hotel and walk right by me,'' he said. ''But the visiting players always came by subway. I was virtually adopted by some of those Browns. They took me into the ball park. Sometimes they even took me on their train trips. When the conductor came around, they'd hide me in an upper berth.'' 
 Arthur Richman turned to a photo of the 1944 Browns celebrating their clinching of the American League pennant. 
 ''See the white cap they're wearing; there's no insignia on it, just a few brown and gold stripes,'' he said. ''I've got one of those caps. I told Martha: 'At my funeral, I want that cap buried with me. Just be sure no collector steals it before they close the coffin.' ''"

 THE most exclusive Oscar party of all will not be held in Hollywood tonight. It will take place in front of a television set in the depths of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, the largest maximum security prison in the country and the setting for ''The Farm,'' which was nominated for best feature documentary. 
 The guest of honor will be Wilbert Rideau, a black man convicted of murdering a white woman 38 years ago, who has edited The Angolite, the prison's award-winning news magazine, for 25 years. Mr. Rideau co-directed ''The Farm'' with the New York filmmakers Liz Garbus and Jonathan Stack, but he is not named on the nomination because an Academy Awards rule permits only two names per documentary. 
 Reporters from around the world have descended on Angola with more intensity than anyone has seen in a while, many to cover the incongruity of Oscar night and the life of a 57-year-old trusty. The execution of Dobie Gillis Williams at the prison in January attracted some unusual attention, mainly because Mr. Williams's ''spiritual adviser'' was Sister Helen Prejean, author of ''Dead Man Walking''(Random House, 1993), which was made into a movie that was filmed at Angola. 
 But Cathy Jett, the prison's executive staff officer in charge of public information, says there hasn't been this much press interest since Mr. Rideau's book, ''Life Sentences'' (Times Books, 1992), was published. It was this collection of Angolite articles that first attracted Ms. Garbus and Mr. Stack. Mr. Rideau's haunting portraits of life and death at Angola became the basis for ''The Farm,'' which documents the lives of six prisoners, one dying, another on death row and four others rehabilitated but with no hope of release in Louisiana's penal system, which reflects a national trend toward lengthy incarceration. 
 Mr. Stack says Angola has always provided ''the kind of material that makes filmmakers salivate.'' It has the same effect on journalists. ''The fact is, the Oscars are not that interesting,'' said Edward Hillmore, who visited Angola for The London Evening Standard.  ''But here's a story that has a lot more to it than who's wearing what designer on Oscar night.'' 
 Angola's pull on journalists and movie people amazes Ms. Jett. ''I went to the opening of 'The Farm' in New York,'' she said, ''and at the dinner I sat down at a table with people from Vogue, and Anne Heche and William Baldwin, you know, and I didn't even get to eat because people kept asking me about what it's like to work here and be a woman and the death penalty and oh, my gosh, what didn't they ask?'' 
 Angola perhaps offers the mystique of exploring what is both exotic and fearsome -- but, like the revolutionaries with round-trip tickets in the V. S. Naipaul essay, ''Killings in Trinidad,'' filmmakers and journalists get to go home. 
 Except, of course, for Mr. Rideau. At 19 he shot two bank employees and stabbed a third, Julia Ferguson, to death during a robbery. Mr. Rideau, whose death sentence was commuted to life when a 1972 Supreme Court ruling overturned capital punishment, has often expressed remorse for his crime. His quarter-century crusade ''to make a difference,'' as he puts it, has earned him acclaim but not freedom. 
 Of late Mr. Rideau has been interviewed by CBS News, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, the German magazine Stern and the lawyer Johnnie Cochran for Court TV, among others. For most of these visitors, the mystique of the prison has given way to the question of why Mr. Rideau is still there. 
 In a 1978 Angolite article, Mr. Rideau, who refuses to write about his own case, said that ''long-term prisoners are hostages of fear and politics, their fate determined by the vagaries of the political mood.'' 
 BACK in the days when Angola was one of the country's most violent prisons, before rehabilitation became an issue, paroles and pardons were probably more possible. In the 1930's, Gov. O. K. Allen released Leadbelly after the future blues legend petitioned him in song. Today, Angola is a model prison, proudly running daily tours of the 5,200-inmate institution, including its state-of-the-art execution chamber. Yet 88 percent of the convicts will never leave, according to the state'sprisons department, regardless of how rehabilitated some become. 
 Mr. Rideau's acclaim -- more than his race and that of the victim and the brutal nature of the crime --  has perhaps increased the prospect that he will be denied clemency. Two governors have scuttled four recommendations by the pardon board to release him. And the lobbying against Mr. Rideau from Calcascieu Parish, where he committed his crime, remains as fervent as ever. 
 Alexandra Geneste, a correspondent for La Croix, the French Catholic daily newspaper, came away from her five-and-a-half-hour interview with Mr. Rideau deeply troubled. ''It was so moving to hear him saying, 'Yes, I was a bad person for sure, but look what I've done and life is not over,' '' she said. ''And I think that we as journalists definitely have to do something for him.'' 
 A front-page article on Mr. Rideau by Ennio Caretto in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera described Angola as ''America's Gulag.'' ''In Italy,'' he said in an interview, ''in a case like his, he would have already been returned to society.'' 
 THE warden, Burl Cain, said in a recent interview: ''If it were up to me, I think he could go free and go to some other state where he could pursue his journalism talents. Wilbert Rideau is not going to kill anybody again, I don't think, or ever rob anybody. He's not about that anymore.'' 
 Mr. Cain said he has seen to it that tonight Mr. Rideau, the other inmates and members of the press will have ''a good TV and refreshments.'' The warden, however, will be at the Oscar presentations in Hollywood in a newly bought tuxedo. While winning would be good, Mr. Cain said, he feels as if ''we've won already.'' The film, he said, has shown the public ''what it needed to see -- the old man dying in prison, the people who I feel are totally rehabilitated, people the public might think would be monsters being totally normal, everyday people who had done horrible things but had worked real hard to change their lives.'' 
 Mr. Rideau wholeheartedly agrees. The nomination and press coverage, which still seem ''unreal'' to him, have brought the film a wider audience, he said last week in a telephone interview. His voice betrayed what he felt at the prospect of watching from so far away. ''I never expected to go,'' he said. ''It would be nice, however, if somebody would mention my name up there if we win.''"

 To the Editor: 
 Martin Feldstein (Op-Ed, March 31) misses a critical point about Social Security: that it must be as certain as the taxes that pay for it and the death that puts an end to it. With the Social Security check in the bank each month, we can spend and plan. 
 This is not possible if a portion depends upon certain stocks. It is possible, however, to invest in the market itself. Companies come and go, but the market keeps rolling. 
 The Government could collect a 5-cent fee for each share bought and sold each day. For example, yesterday the market was down over 100 points, but two billion shares were traded. That would amount to $200 million, or $50 billion a year. 
 With interest, we begin to achieve a modest supplement for those who may never see the inside of a  401(k).

 Top American military officers flew here today in an apparent effort to lay the basis for deploying more American forces -- possibly including ground troops -- in NATO's effort to stop Serbs from driving ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. 
 Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the NATO commander, arrived at mid-afternoon and immediately drove from the once decrepit airport, now swarming with helicopters and relief supplies, to meetings with Albanian Government officials. 
 His trip was so suddenly arranged that United States Air Force press officers at the airport had no inkling of it until queried by journalists in the late morning. 
 After his talks, General Clark said American Apache helicopters ''will be arriving here very shortly,'' but declined to give a date. ''It's a matter of finishing our coordination and preparation here to receive them,'' he said. 
 General Clark also condemned what he called plans by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia ''to threaten, harass and intimidate neighboring states,'' including Albania, whose northern territory has been subjected to sporadic Serbian shelling. 
 General Clark's second in command, Lieut. Gen. Dan Coffee, the deputy commander in Europe, was here on Friday to assess the resources available in this impoverished country, which has taken in more than 300,000 Kosovo refugees. 
 While military officials were tight-lipped, it is possible that the visits could presage some change in NATO tactics of relying on bombing alone. Air strikes have damaged the Yugoslav infrastructure but apparently not interfered with the Serbs' drive to purge Kosovo of ethnic Albanians. 
 Indeed, a wave of about 13,000 new refugees crossed the Albanian border at Kukes during the night, relief workers said. Many of the new refugees, relief workers say, are people who have been hiding in the woods and mountains for weeks. They are suffering from exposure, hunger and dehydration. 
 In advance of a key vote in Congress on a special appropriation measure for the Kosovo campaign, a Congressional delegation flew in to visit the refugee camps. 
 Standing slightly apart from the delegation, Maj. Gen. Randy West of the Marines quietly eyed the scene, taking a longer view. 
 ''I'm here to gather my own intel,'' General West said, referring to intelligence information he might need if marines were sent here in large numbers. General West is the commander of the Second Marine Expeditionary Force based at Camp Lejeune, N.C. 
 One Marine expeditionary unit from the Sixth Fleet is already in the area, and another is on the way, General West said. But, he added, he wanted to be ready for the possibility that larger numbers of marines might be called on. 
 A Marine expeditionary unit is a roughly regimental sized strike force, based on a ship, with its own attached helicopters, Harrier jump jets and other close-in support aircraft and some small amphibious armored vehicles. It numbers roughly 2,000 to 2,400 troops and is commanded by a colonel. 
 During the Kurdish refugee crisis in southern Turkey after the Persian Gulf war of 1991, marines, who can be quickly deployed from their ships, were used to provide relief and to protect Kurdish refugees seeking to return to Iraq. 
 Marines could also be used to provide perimeter security for the long-awaited Apache helicopters. 
 But the major strength of the marines is as a quick mobile strike force, capable of attacking enemy positions in helicopter assault or opening a beachhead for more heavily equipped conventional forces. 
 Both of the Marine Expeditionary Units that do six-month rotations with the Sixth Fleet are trained in unconventional, small-unit tactics like fighting terrorists or rescuing hostages.

"296","Decisive Moment on Parkinson's Fetal-Cell Transplants",1101503,"|science|health",20,4,1999,"19990420T000000",NA," 
 In the 14 years since discovering he has Parkinson's disease, Steve Ashworth has slowly lost control of his muscles. Two years ago, with simple tasks like brushing his teeth becoming next to impossible, he eagerly signed up for a chance to stave off his slide into immobility, the first Government-financed study of brain-cell transplants using tissue from aborted fetuses. 
 But the use of fetal cells was not all that made the experiment controversial. Like all 40 people who enrolled, Mr. Ashworth, a 53-year-old labor negotiator for General Motors, would have to undergo brain surgery: four tiny holes drilled into the skull through the wrinkle lines above his eyebrows. Yet only half the participants would get the tissue. The other half would get nothing. 
 In July 1997, Mr. Ashworth flew from his home in Martinsburg, W.Va., to Denver for the surgery. Lying sedated on the operating table, with a stainless steel halo bolted to his head, he listened carefully to the doctors' conversation, hoping for clues about whether he would receive the cells that might repair his damaged brain. 
 Thirteen months later came the official word: his surgery was a fake. He has since been waiting for the study results to decide if he wants the real thing. 
 ''I thought it sounded like my best chance of walking away'' from the disease, Mr. Ashworth said. ''My life has been on hold, waiting for this study to come to a conclusion.'' 
 On Wednesday, the wait will be over for Mr. Ashworth and tens of thousands of Parkinson's patients who have seen their symptoms worsen while fetal cell research became caught up in abortion politics. At a conference in Toronto, Dr. Curt Freed, the University of Colorado neuroscientist who led the study, will announce his results, 11 years after President Reagan first banned the use of taxpayer money for such research, and six years after President Clinton lifted that ban. 
 As the first placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial using fetal cells for Parkinson's, the study is what scientists call a ''proof of principle'' experiment, one designed to see if the treatment has any effect. 
 ''I don't think anybody is going to look at this study and say, 'Wow, that is a cure,' '' Dr. Freed said in an interview. 
 But if the study confirms what he and others have long suspected, that injecting fetal cells into the brain can help patients regain lost motor function and reduce their need for medication, it will undoubtedly generate patient demand for the procedure and spur further public and private investment in the research. 
 Regardless of the outcome, the study is leaving its mark on medicine in another fashion, by helping to legitimize the use of ''sham surgery.'' The practice, long out of favor, is described by proponents as state-of-the-art medicine. But critics, including some Parkinson's researchers, say it is unethical to use a placebo that, unlike a simple sugar pill, carries some risk. 
 ''This is not a placebo,'' said Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the study's most vociferous opponents. ''It is a phony surgical operation. You could wind up with a hole in your head for nothing.'' 
 The placebo effect is well known in medical research, and experts say it is particularly powerful with a dramatic intervention like surgery. That has posed a problem for Dr. Freed and other researchers who have performed fetal cell transplants over the past decade with private money. Although some of those patients got better, scientists could not be certain if the fetal cells were responsible, or if they improved simply because they knew they had been treated. To get a true measure of success, they had to compare people who got the cells with people who thought they had, said Dr. Michael D. Walker of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, which paid for Dr. Freed's $4.5 million study. 
 ''If we are going to end up treating thousands of patients this way in the future,'' Dr. Walker said, ''we jolly well better know whether it is effective.'' 
 It is unlikely that thousands of patients will be getting fetal cells anytime soon, because the surgery is complicated and aborted fetuses are hard to obtain. But if Dr. Freed's research shows real promise, experts say, scientists will quickly turn their attention to finding alternate sources of the tissue, perhaps through another controversial area of investigation that has touched off an abortion rights controversy, the use of stem cells that come from human embryos. 
 More than one million Americans suffer from Parkinson's disease, a degenerative condition that kills the brain cells that produce dopamine, a neurochemical that controls motor function. Stiffness and tremors are the primary symptoms. Mr. Ashworth wakes up each morning so bent over, he says, that he shuffles around ''like a 70-year-old'' until his medication kicks in. His speech is affected as well; he talks softly and slowly, as though his mouth needs time to get out the words his brain is telling him to say. 
 There are a handful of medications for Parkinson's disease, but they eventually stop working, leaving patients to face a future that Mr. Ashworth says ''can scare the wits out of you. You wind up bedridden and unable to control your bodily movements, but your brain is intact.'' 
 Dr. Freed, who at 56 has spent his entire career studying Parkinson's,  said he concluded in the early 1980's that ''drugs would not be the answer, that we had to approach the disease with a dynamic cell therapy'' to restore the missing dopamine. From studies on rats, he knew that dopamine-producing cells could be taken from an embryo and placed in the brain, and that the cells would survive. By 1988, he was planning to perform the surgery on people. 
 In March of that year, the Reagan Administration imposed a moratorium on Federal financing for all medical research involving fetal tissue. That November, on the same day George Bush was elected President, Dr. Freed performed the first fetal cell transplant in the United States. The patient was a retired factory manager, Don Nelson, who had been fighting Parkinson's for 20 years; the operation was paid for with private money. 
 Today, Mr. Nelson, 62, is doing well enough to help his son build a house. The cells from the first transplant have died off; he had a second one five years ago. ''It has helped me immensely,'' he said. ''Screws and nails and things were hard to hold. I could hardly pick them up and now there's no problem.'' 
 While President Bush left the ban intact, Dr. Freed continued his work, operating with private money. So did a handful of others, including researchers at Yale University led by Dr. Gene Redmond. When Mr. Clinton, who had pledged to rescind the ban, was elected, the researchers began preparing Federal grant applications. 
 Dr. Freed teamed up with Dr. Stanley Fahn, a neuroscientist at Columbia Presbyterian Center in Manhattan; their study, with its placebo design, was approved, as was a similar proposal from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and the University of South Florida. Dr. Redmond also submitted a grant proposal, but the National Institutes of Health turned it down because it had no placebo group. 
 ''We felt it was not appropriate to do a sham procedure,'' Dr. Redmond said last week. He is continuing with animal research, hoping to perfect his technique before operating again on people. ''I have not regretted that we did not do the study the way they wanted it done,'' he said. 
 In Dr. Freed's experiment, patients were awake but sedated for the hourlong operation. Surgeons drilled the four holes, clearing a path to the putamen, a structure on each side of the brain that controls movement. For those in the placebo group, the operation stopped there. For the other 20, surgeons inserted long needles into the putamen, injecting about two droplets worth of tissue, 2 million dopamine cells in all. The hope, Dr. Freed said, was that 100,000 of those cells would take hold. 
 The transplant carried a small risk of hemorrhage and stroke, Dr. Freed said, while the risk of the phony surgery, ''is similar to the risk of going to the dentist.'' Each of the 20 placebo patients was offered the fetal cells 13 months after the original surgery; so far, 14 have gone back for a second operation. 
 Among them is Lynda McKenzie, a 46-year-old former crafts shop owner from a suburb of Toronto. She had the transplant last October and noticed a difference within six weeks. ''I'm very hopeful and I do believe it's working for me,'' Ms. McKenzie said last week. ''I don't feel at the mercy of Parkinson's so much.'' 
 Mr. Ashworth, who said he understood the need for the sham surgery, was hopeful too, but cautious. Dr. Freed, who is continuing to improve his surgical technique, tells patients that the longer they can put off surgery, the better. For Mr. Ashworth, the decision will depend on the results released this week. 
 ''If it enables me to get off the medicine, to go to the mall and walk around without having to worry about am I going to be able to get back home, then I will definitely go through with it,'' he said. If not, he will continue to wait."

"298","Brown Disposes of His Disposable Income",1106618,"|sports",10,5,1999,"19990510T000000",NA," 
 The National Basketball Association has suffered through a long, antagonistic labor fight this season and glumly weathered the retirement of the matchless Michael Jordan. Soon, however, it could face truly bad news. 
 Giants running back Gary Brown has almost run out of things to buy at the N.B.A. Store in midtown Manhattan. This is a serious, bottom-line issue. 
 A big fan of the league, who likes to impersonate his basketball heroes in pickup basketball games, Brown has spent about $10,000 lately in a zealous pursuit of authentic apparel for each of the league's 29 teams. 
 Game jerseys retailing at $120, shorts at $95, and warm-up jackets at $90 -- not to mention $55 warm-up tear-away pants and $60 shooting shirts -- Brown has them all, for every team but a few. 
 And he has his eye on completing the set. Then the complete uniform for the entire league would be in Gary Brown's closet. 
 ''We're always glad to see him come into the store,'' Steve Alic, the N.B.A.'s coordinator of marketing communications, said of Brown last week. ''But we're a little nervous. He's pretty close to having one of everything. And when he does that, it's going to hurt us more than losing Jordan.'' 
 Asked about these spending sprees along Madison Avenue, Brown smiles impishly, like a child caught hoarding candy. 
 ''You have to understand, I grew up in Williamsport, Pa., I've never seen a store like that,'' he said. 
 Brown first visited the store in October last year. 
 ''I was a little in awe, I didn't buy too much,'' Brown said. ''The next couple of times it was about $1,000 each visit. Now, I go in there, point and say: 'I need that, that, and that.' '' 
 Brown's love of the N.B.A. runs deep. He was the Giants' leading rusher last season with 1,063 yards, expanding his National Football League career-rushing total to 4,123 yards. But he would like to have been a pro basketball player. 
 ''I would have had to be 6-foot-5 instead of what I am, 5-foot-10,'' said Brown, who is also 230 pounds. 
 That does not stop him from doing a little fantasy pickup game impersonating in the off season -- with authentic wear, of course. 
 ''If I'm going out to play one day and I feel like being Larry Johnson,'' Brown said. ''Then I'll put on my Larry Johnson jersey and all the other stuff. I'll be Larry Johnson that day. Next day, maybe it's Antoine Walker. Next day, Kevin Garnett.'' 
 And on all the other days? 
 ''The N.B.A. apparel is very comfortable to wear anywhere,'' Brown said. 
 When Brown is not wearing or adding to his hoop dreams wardrobe, he is working out four days a week at Giants Stadium during the most comfortable off season he has spent in several years. 
 He will be heading to Giants training camp on July 29 as the established starter at running back -- the first time he goes into camp as a starter since 1994 when he was coming off a 1,000-yard rushing season with the Houston Oilers. 
 And yet, Brown, 29, knows the Giants drafted two running backs last month, Ohio State's Joe Montgomery and Northwestern's Sean Bennett. He hears that people around the league have a way of belittling his talents even though he has gained 2,008 yards in the past two seasons, averaging 4 yards a carry. He hears when it is said he does not have breakaway speed. He hears that the Giants need a dominant running back. 
 He gets tired of it. 
 ''Of course, if somebody tells you that stuff enough you get tired of hearing it,'' Brown said. ''But I say, look at the numbers. I'm productive. People say I'm slow, but if you watch tape, I run by people. 
 ''I may not look like I'm moving, but you look up and I've gained 7  yards, or 15 yards.'' 
 Brown, a stocky, between-the-tackles back, thinks his game may never be completely appreciated in part because he isn't elusive in a classic sense. 
 ''Look, I'm not graceful but if I get in front of you, you're not going to catch me,'' he said. ''Everybody wants Barry Sanders who nobody can touch or catch, but there aren't 31 Barry Sanders out there. I just want somebody to say, you know, he's a pretty good running back.'' 
 Brown plans to hold his starting job this summer -- despite the competition from the rookies and Tiki Barber -- and help an offense the Giants are desperately trying to resurrect from the basement of the league. 
 First, though, in the waning months of this off season, a few more visits to the N.B.A. Store. 
 ''I'm not maxed out because I'm still short on the sets for Orlando, Phoenix, Philly and Indianapolis,'' he said. 
 And when he goes an N.B.A. 29 for 29? ''Well, there are teams that change their uniforms every year,'' Brown said, grinning at the thought. ''I've got to keep up.''

"302","The Radar New York Needs",1121575,"|opinion",7,7,1999,"19990707T000000","|New York City"," 
 It took several calamitous accidents to persuade Congress and the commercial aviation industry to develop a radar system to detect wind shear, the severe downdrafts that cause airplanes to lose control. That system is now in use or scheduled to be built nationwide -- except in New York, where politics and bureaucratic infighting in Washington have stalled the installation of devices that can give air traffic controllers advance warning. 
 Wind shear was implicated in the 1975 crash of an airliner approaching Kennedy Airport, a disaster in which 112 people perished. This tragedy, as well as others near New Orleans in 1982 and at Dallas in 1985, persuaded Congress to finance more than 40 Doppler weather radar systems for air terminals. The 38 in operation today and 6 under development will give the nation another defense against wind shear. Unfortunately, 24 years after the 1975 crash and nearly a decade since the device became available, there is no wind-shear radar for Kennedy or La Guardia airports. 
 In the mid-1990's Senator Alfonse D'Amato blocked the Federal Aviation Administration's effort to install two wind-shear radars in Nassau County, his home turf and the heart of his political base, to serve Kennedy and La Guardia. Congress then directed the F.A.A. to install a single radar system for both airports somewhere else. Now the F.A.A. and the Department of the Interior are deadlocked over the F.A.A.'s alternative plan. The F.A.A. wants to install the wind-shear radar tower on a 1.8-acre Brooklyn site inside the 1,539 acres of Floyd Bennett Field. The airfield in turn is part of the 26,000-acre Gateway National Recreation Area. 
 Interior officials argue that building an 82-foot tower with a 37-foot ball on top would violate the spirit, if not the letter, of the law governing Gateway. Since Interior, through the National Park Service, has given the New York Police Department a long-term lease to use the airfield for its helicopters, its case against the radar is somewhat compromised. Interior ought to press for an accord under which the F.A.A. will remove the radar when improved technology and alternative sites become available. 
 New York's airports are among the nation's busiest. Barring the emergence of a technically sound case for another site, air travelers' needs should trump the Interior Department's objections to the short-term use of a small slice of public parkland. The final arbiters of this dispute, the Justice Department and the White House, should settle this matter quickly and err on the side of enhancing air safety."

 When New York officials selected the first eight charter schools for the state last month, they did so knowing that the school to open in Flushing, Queens, would be run by a Middle Eastern company that recently lost its contract to operate two charter schools in Chicago. 
 Some education officials in New York knew of the company's dismissal, but neither investigated it nor informed the public about it before giving preliminary approval to the Flushing school, according to interviews with officials in New York and Chicago. 
 Educators in Chicago say that the company, Sabis, was criticized by a number of teachers and parents who were concerned about the company's teaching methods and style of management. 
 Several said that English and math tests -- faxed weekly from Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates -- often came in at the last minute, had questions unrelated to classroom instruction and used British rather than American spellings (''realising'' instead of ''realizing,'' for instance). 
 Other teachers and parents said the intensive tutoring that was supposed to be the core of Sabis's program took more than a year to be set up at one school and never had enough staff at either school. And parents complained that they were discouraged from meeting privately with teachers and were kept in the dark about administrative decisions. 
 An official of the State University of New York, which oversees part of the charter school system, said that some trustees were aware of Sabis's dismissal, but also said that Sabis had a good record in Massachusetts. He said the trustees accepted the company's explanation that the problems in Chicago were unrelated to education issues. 
 Sabis maintains that it lost its Chicago contract because of administrative and personality clashes. 
 In New York and elsewhere, charter schools are financed by taxpayer money, but largely escape the restrictions imposed on public schools, and scrutiny from school administrators and teachers unions. 
 The New York Times examined the two other private companies that have received preliminary approval to run three of New York's eight initial charter schools and found no major problems or contract disputes in their backgrounds. 
 The other four schools are to be run by nonprofit foundations. 
 Scott W. Steffey, a SUNY vice chancellor who supervises the charter school process, said it was not the state's responsibility to evaluate Sabis's record. He said the community group that selected Sabis was supposed to check its references. ''I don't choose the management firm; that's not my job and that's not my role,'' he said. 
 The Flushing group, a loose coalition of parents, educators and volunteers, said it did not do so because it was busy putting together its application to the state, inspecting potential school sites and gathering support for the charter school. 
 Piero A. Tozzi, a lawyer who led the Flushing effort, said the group learned about Sabis from a list of management companies provided by the New York Charter School Resource Center, a nonprofit organization that helps people apply for charters. 
 The resource center did not look into Sabis's background, either, said Gerry Vazquez, the center's president. 
 Mr. Tozzi, now aware of criticisms of Sabis's Chicago schools, said he continued to support the selection of Sabis to run the Flushing school. 
 Sabis has sued the nonprofit foundation that oversees the two Chicago schools for breach of contract. In interviews and legal papers, company officials have characterized their dismissal last December as a dispute over contractual issues like building repairs, fund-raising and management of future schools. 
 The foundation's directors have refused to comment publicly or to release a detailed termination letter because the matter is in court. But a lawyer for the foundation said it was not satisfied with Sabis's overall performance. 
 A Chicago education official who has seen the termination letter said the foundation's directors felt that Sabis had failed to deliver the education program it had promised. ''It wasn't that Sabis offered to do something that couldn't be done,'' said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ''But for whatever reasons, they weren't working the way they were supposed to in Chicago.'' 
 Sabis also operates 3 charter schools in Massachusetts that have had no major problems, one private school in Minnesota and 14 others in the Middle East, England and Germany. But when pressed for details, several educators and charter school consultants acknowledged that they knew very little about the company. 
 Sabis's director is Ralph Bistany, a citizen of Lebanon and France who received master's degrees in math and physics from the American University of Beirut. In a telephone interview from Juniye, Lebanon, Mr. Bistany suggested that the company's problems in Chicago stemmed from clashes with the foundation over administrative and contractual matters. 
 Since then, he said, Sabis -- which began with a private school just outside Beirut -- has also won approval to open charter schools in Michigan, North Carolina and the District of Columbia. 
 ''I think we've learned a lesson,'' Mr. Bistany said of his experience in Chicago, conceding that the company had hired poor administrators. ''But whenever we are under pressure, we concentrate on the education.'' 
 That there has been no investigation or any sort of public discussion in New York about Sabis's problems in Chicago raises new questions about the selection process for the charter schools. 
 The trustees, accused by Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew and others of acting in secret when they approved the eight charter schools last month, are scheduled to conduct a second vote today on the three schools to open in the fall. The other five, including the Flushing school, are to open in 2000. 
 New York's charter school law allows SUNY and the State Board of Regents to grant up to 50 charters each to groups of parents, teachers or administrators, or to community groups and foundations, to set up the new schools. In turn, those groups can hire private companies to run the schools. 
 After the law passed, SUNY moved quickly to establish a Charter School Institute to encourage and screen applications. On June 15, the university's trustees selected the first group of schools, subject to a final review by the Board of Regents. 
 The Flushing International Charter School plans to enroll 249 students in kindergarten through fourth grade in the first year, and eventually expand to 1,400 students from kindergarten through 12th grade. Language classes in Mandarin Chinese would be offered to serve the predominantly Asian community. 
 Sabis would pay $1.3 million in start-up and operating costs for five years, according to its application with a community group in Flushing. The school would also receive an estimated $29.1 million in public money during that time. A building has not yet been leased. 
 Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly education committee, said the final responsibility for checking out Sabis belonged to state education officials. ''They have been negligent and casual in their interpretation and enforcement of charter school law in order to hasten the process,'' he said. 
 Mr. Steffey, the SUNY official, said he was aware of Sabis's canceled contract in Chicago but acknowledged that no one from SUNY had pursued the matter in depth with the Chicago foundation or public school officials. 
 He said that at a conference last March, two members of the Chicago foundation were on a panel that discussed contractual problems with management companies. Mr. Steffey said he asked questions from the audience, but did not hear anything that caused him concern. 
 Members of the five-member advisory panel of charter school founders and academic consultants that reviewed the Flushing school application were aware of Sabis's record in Chicago, but did not review it in detail, focusing instead on the mission of the Flushing school. 
 Sabis -- the name is a hybrid of Mr. Bistany's and that of his partner, Leila Saad -- is a family-run company that includes the network of charter schools and private schools, real estate holdings and a computer business in Beirut. Mr. Bistany declined to give more specific information about the company's activities and finances. 
 The company branch that manages charter schools, Sabis Educational Systems, is a business name for the International School of Minnesota, the private school founded by Sabis in 1985. The school is owned by an offshore company, which in turn is owned by the Sabis Foundation in Liechtenstein, Mr. Bistany said. 
 Sabis's two Chicago schools, situated on opposite sides of the city, had 1,700 students, just over half of the city's charter school enrollment. One school was predominantly black and Hispanic, while the other was racially mixed, according to education officials, and both drew students from working-class and middle-class families. 
 Although students performed well on yearly standardized exams -- one measure of a charter school's progress -- there were signs of problems. Sabis replaced three principals, known as directors, in the first year, and several teachers described a general disorganization that included the last-minute tests faxed from Abu Dhabi. 
 ''Things were basically run by the seat of the pants,'' said Jerry Mash, a former principal. ''We all complained, but it just fell on deaf ears. Mr. Bistany said this is the way it is.'' 
 Parents also complained, saying that Sabis resisted their efforts to volunteer at the school. ''I felt, and other parents did, too, that the school really wasn't welcoming us,'' said Yoko Gely, whose son was a second grader at a Sabis school. 
 Mr. Steffey, the SUNY official, said he had not heard these criticisms, though he added that he and his staff had met with Sabis officials and had read Sabis's lawsuit against the foundation for breach of contract. 
 He emphasized that the review process had not yet been completed, noting that a public hearing would take place before the charter was actually granted. 
 After being informed of the criticisms about Sabis, Mr. Tozzi, of the Flushing group, said he obtained a copy of Sabis's termination letter and talked to an education official in Chicago. ''It hasn't changed my mind,'' he said last week.

"305","Why Dig for Gold, if There Are Clams?",1129872,"|dining|wine|style",11,8,1999,"19990811T000000",NA," 
 CLAMMING is a primordial experience. All it involves is walking slowly in the ocean at low tide, bending over and groping in the sediment in search of a hard, slightly rounded shape. Clamming requires no equipment, except maybe a bucket. It demands no talent, except a notion of where the clams are. Like fishing, trapping and hunting, it is one of the most ancient ways to gather food. 
 The laziest clammers, like me, meet a clam on its own rhythmic terms. We burrow together. I wade into two feet of water, sit down and grope about in the mud. Others are more energetic, or better equipped. Tom Thompson, a retired banker who clams in Huntington Bay, on the North Shore of Long Island, uses a rake and carries a wire basket on a float to keep his catch alive. Tom Colicchio, executive chef at Gramercy Tavern in Manhattan, learned at age 3 to feel for clams with his feet and take along a bushel basket to float in an inner tube. 
 Professional clammers work year round using hydraulic dredges or a 20-foot-long implement known as a bull rake. Amateurs usually do their clamming by hand in summer, when the water is soft and warm and the surf a mere ruffle. On the East Coast, all search for three kinds of clams. 
 The hard-shell clam is known locally as the northern quahog (or Mercenaria mercenaria, from the days when the Indians used the shells as wampum). Littlenecks (1 1/2 inches across), topnecks (2 inches) cherrystones (2 1/2 inches) and chowders (3 1/2 inches) are all quahogs, at different ages and stages of tenderness. The fragile-shelled steamer clam is also local, as are slender razor clams, about 3 inches long and an inch wide. 
 The Encyclopedia Britannica calls clams ''boring bivalves,'' but if their lives are monotonous, their afterlives certainly aren't. They have a sweet briny flavor and a pleasing chewiness that makes them irresistible raw with a squeeze of lemon, or steamed in white wine with garlic and parsley or, in the simplest of sandwiches, batter-fried and stuffed into a soft roll with tartar sauce, lettuce and tomato. 
 Clams probably show up more often in chowders than anyplace else, and these days the choice is no longer between just creamy New England and red Manhattan. At Gramercy Tavern, Mr. Colicchio makes a chowder with leeks, fingerling potatoes and onions (and ramps, in season), heightening it with fresh, lemony sorrel. And at the Lobster Club, Anne Rosenzweig steams clams in white wine, olive oil and garlic, reserving the broth for her classic creamy New England chowder, along with scallions and kernels of fresh, sweet milky corn. 
 Clams reveal their origin when it comes time to cook them. They need to be scrubbed seriously to get rid of all the grit they have been burrowing in. And they need to come out of their shells. The easiest way to open a clam is to steam it until the shell pops open; prying it open with a knife is dangerous for the inexperienced. Most shops will sell clams shucked as long as they are to be eaten or cooked within the hour. Otherwise, customers are advised to take them home closed. Clams should be kept uncovered and dry on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator, where the temperature is 38 to 40 degrees. 
 Digging your own, though, gives instant gratification. In 20 minutes, in a densely populated clam colony, a lazy clammer can dig up 48 clams, just the right amount for most chowder recipes. A $5 license from town hall in Huntington, N.Y., for example, allows an amateur clammer to gather half a bushel of shellfish a day, including no more than 100 hard-shell clams. Not a bad price for shopping in nature's store. 
 WARM CLAM SALAD WITH FRESH HERBS AND TOMATOES  Adapted from Gramercy Tavern  Time: 25 minutes 
 1 red tomato  1 orange or yellow tomato  24 littleneck clams, well scrubbed  1 shallot, peeled and chopped  2 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped 
 1/4 cup white wine  Sprig of parsley  2 tablespoons lemon juice 
 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 
 1/4 cup mixed green and purple basil leaves 
 1/4 cup parsley leaves  Salt and freshly ground black pepper. 
 1. Bring a medium saucepan half-full of water to a boil. Immerse tomatoes 10 seconds; then remove and rinse with cold water. Peel and seed tomatoes. Dice them and set aside. 
 2. In a large saucepan, combine clams, shallot, garlic, wine and parsley sprig. Cover, place over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, and cook until all the shells open, 8 to 10 minutes. Check the pan occasionally, and transfer open clams to a bowl to prevent overcooking. When all clams have opened, set them aside in the bowl. 
 3. Strain broth in saucepan; there should be about  1/2 cup. Transfer to a blender, and add lemon juice. With machine running, slowly add olive oil. Return mixture to a large saucepan over medium heat. When broth is simmering, add clams in their shells, and tomatoes. When clams are heated, in 5 to 10 seconds, remove from heat and add basil and parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Toss to mix well. Serve immediately. 
 Yield: 4 servings.

 The numerals are Roman, but the food is Argentine. LX, on East 60th Street in Manhattan, is a dark and handsome newcomer that goes beyond the gaucho-steak formula to explore regional Argentine specialties. 
 Carlos Benavides, the chef, is from Buenos Aires, and he uses the empanada as his culinary soapbox, changing the ingredients constantly to showcase a different style or region of Argentina. 
 Last week, for example, he reached out to the northwestern province of San Luis for a stuffing of grilled chicken, red and green peppers, Argentine chorizo, raisins and green olives. 
 Argentine chorizo, sweeter and milder than its Spanish cousin, figures prominently in a delicious soup of pureed asparagus with crunchy slices of hearts of palm. The tamal de Tucuman is a whopper, thick walled and blunt, with a stuffing of veal, raisins, bell peppers and squash puree. 
 There's an Argentine ribeye steak, of course, but I preferred the generous skirt steak, fanned around half a large plate and served with a fresh green chimichurri sauce and a spicy sun-dried-tomato relish. Best bets among the desserts are the coconut flan and the irresistible crepes, filled with dulce de leche and cream cheese. 
 Up front, where the doors open onto the sidewalk, LX looks like a dozen other Manhattan cafes. In back, however, it feels like a private railway car from the last century, with lustrous mahogany walls and dainty shaded wall lamps. 
 The film posters are a nice touch: Argentine advertisements for schlocky Hollywood films from the 1940's and 50's, like ''Jungle Siren,'' with Ann Corio.

 LIKE the whisper of the pines that tower around her churches, Pastor Susan Flicker speaks softly of things in a community that are everlasting. In so doing, she is breathing life and spirit back into a half-dozen towns in South Jersey. 
 She has visions, speaks often to the Almighty and gets answers that she shares with her congregations. She has turned areas populated with the introverted, isolated and often underprivileged into New Jersey's version of Mayberry or perhaps  ''Touched by an Angel.'' 
 Pastor Flicker, 50, has an old-world approach to modern-day life, matching her ministry to her four historic churches that were founded in 1808, 1823 1847 and 1875. 
 Ms. Flicker is on call 24 hours a day for counseling, visiting hospitals and attending events from piano recitals to soccer games. ''It is important that people here know that I am interested in them and the lives they lead outside our church walls,'' she said. ''This is not a maintenance ministry.'' 
 She graduated from Thomas Edison College in Trenton with a bachelor's degree in history and took her first job as director of the Country Day Nursery School in St. Lawrence, Pa., in the early 1970's. 
 Always interested in being a caretaker of others, she left for a job at Caring Inc. of Atlantic County, setting up group homes for the elderly and running a day care center. 
 A divorced mother of two grown sons, Pastor Sue, as she is known throughout the Pine Barrens, dabbled in several careers. But when her sons graduated high school,  she entered Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wynnwood, Pa. 
 After graduating in 1990, she gave up on her more lucrative endeavors for a job that paid less than $12,000 a year -- part-time pastor at the First United Methodist Church of Batsto. When the job became full time a year ago, she was raised to $22,000. 
 ''It's not about money,'' she said. ''It is a pure joy to go with people on the journey through their lives from baptisms to marriages and into death. You can't pay someone to do that. They do that for something more than money.'' 
 Born and reared in Wilmington, Del., and later a resident of Ocean City, she wanted to minister to inner-city youths. Instead, she was assigned a parish in the Pines. 
 ''I did wonder what God was thinking,'' Ms. Flicker said. ''But he knew me better than I knew myself. I have a heart for people. I can feel their pain. I've been there myself. There is brokenness in my life that has healed. Because of that I can see people's pain and help them handle it.'' 
 She will not speak of her marriage except to say that it was a painful part of her life until she divorced in 1980. 
 She spoke of a host of other things, though, on a hot August afternoon, during an interview at the old Batsto church, where the wooden pews were hewn in 1808 and an ancient, potbellied stove sits like a large black bear. 
 Unlike modern places of worship where electric candles flare, this church smells of freshly melted beeswax, oily wood soap and maybe just a hint of brimstone. 
 Ms. Flicker pointed to the cracks in the whitewashed walls and told of the days in the 1930's when legions of bees made their home behind the walls. Honey dripped from the cracks and onto the wooden floorboards. The congregation then worked together to collect this ambrosia for bottling and sale to support the parish. 
 Ms. Flicker is loathe to take credit for her works saying: ''I'm not doing this. What is happening here, in these communities, is happening because people are working together.'' 
 Before she became their leader nine years ago, the Methodist churches in Egg Harbor City, Lower Bank, Green Bank, Mullica, South Hampton, Sicklerville and Wading River were nearly empty. Some congregations numbered in the single digits. 
 The pastor took fading churches -- Batsto, Nesco, Green Bank and Lower Bank United Methodist -- and linked them to one pastor: herself. The combination of parishes is called the United Methodist Pinelands Charge. 
 Her residents say she gave them a sense of focus, community and empowerment.  Ask her to talk about herself and the answer is: ''I'm nobody. I spent my life as a mother and went through a lot of careers before I heard the call to the ministry.'' 
 One son, 30-year-old Michael, who lives in Hickory, N.C., where he is an athletic trainer, said in a telephone interview that he supported his mother's choice of careers. 
 She even performed his wedding ceremony to his wife, Karen, three years ago at the church here. ''That made the vows even more special,'' he said. 
 He added: ''My brother Scott and I used to joke that it was hard to go away to college and leave a regular Mom at home and come back to a preacher. You try and find a support group for that.'' 
 She acts as a cross between a mother and a sort of air traffic controller for the soul. Ms. Flicker has every member of her flock on the radar screen. She can recite phone numbers, birthdays, anniversaries, names of uncles who are ailing and babies who were born. 
 She is constantly helping parishioners  with everything from meals to mental health. All through the hot, dusty summer she worked with blueberry farmers who were angry with God over the drought. 
 ''They just needed someone to tell them not to give up,'' she said. 
 She has counseled workers who lost jobs when three major businesses (a boat works, a cookie factory and Whitehall-Robbins Inc.) closed their doors. 
 Residents say several of them were in the grip of searing poverty, self-doubt, alcoholism, drug addiction and in many cases,  abuse from their husbands. Others were simply marking time until the day they would add to the number at the town cemetery. 
 ''Her presence has strengthened the ties between the churches in our communities,' said Linda Thibault, 50, of Nesco. 
 Ms. Thibault added: ''I've lived here my whole life and I've been going to the Batsto Church since I was two years old. I've never seen someone like her.'' 
 People who live deep in the Pines are known for their reclusive ways. Indeed, some live so far in the woods that they have never seen a neighbor's home. 
 ''She taught us to reach out to each other and not be so inward looking,'' Ms. Thibault said. ''She taught us to see a brighter future than we ever imagined. Parents' groups, youth groups, grief support, fund drives for the needy, outreach programs and a food closet -- who would have dreamed we could do that?'' 
 Ms. Flicker works extensively with abused women, substance abusers, teen-age rebels and the elderly. She also has prison ministries at the Atlantic County Jail in Mays Landing and at the Bayside State Prison in Leesburg, where she helps inmates and their families cope with their problems and plan for the future. She is also  on call to minister to the William B. Kessler Hospital in Hammonton. 
 A large part of her work consists of helping couples prepare for marriage, and it is there that her approach is most unique. 
 ''When we came to Pastor Sue three years ago to get ready for our marriage, she worked with us for about six months,'' said  Karen Barnett, 42, of Sweetwater. ''She had us write a covenant of things we would do together in the marriage. That really floored me.'' 
 Brutal honesty and in-depth research into couples' personalities and understanding of each other is the mainstay of her pre-marital counseling sessions. With her help, couples say they were more prepared for the bumps in the marital road. 
 ''If she doesn't think the marriage will work, she will tell you point-blank,'' said Mrs. Barnett. ''If she sees character conflicts or flaws she makes you see them so that years down the road you can't claim to be surprised.'' 
 Mrs. Barnett explained that the Batsto Church and the others were in dire financial straits when the pastor arrived. Members desperately wanted to make Ms. Flicker a full-time pastor but could not afford to pay or house her. None of the churches had a parsonage she could call home. 
 ''We just all got together and decided to go ahead with it all on faith,'' Mrs. Barnett said. ''Oh, there were those who yelled and screamed all the way that it couldn't be done. They're not saying that now.'' 
 When the district superintendent for the Methodist Churches wanted to reassign Ms. Flicker two years ago, members of the churches banded together to change his mind. ''We won, and then we had to find the money,'' Mrs. Barnett said. 
 To hear church members tell it, faith in their pastor didn't move mountains, but it certainly did move loan officers and grant committees. The parsonage was bought on a mortgage, and the United Methodist Council gave them an $8,000 grant. With attendance at all the churches increasing, the collections went up as well. 
 They started a food closet for the needy. Last month, the new parish youth group raised money for a local man suffering from pancreatic cancer by making a parade float that won a $500 prize. Now the members of these United Methodist churches are working on new dreams, like a community center and a nature center for the Pine Barrens. 
 ''Bottom line here -- if you have a dream and you can accomplish it alone then you didn't dream big enough,'' Mrs. Barnett said. ''If you have a dream so big that you all have to work together, then it's of God. We had to step out there together and take some chances. We would have never done that without Pastor Sue to guide us.'' 
 Four Historic Churches, Rocks of the Ages 
 THERE are places in New Jersey where the hand of time has been stayed. In the southern part of the state, four historic churches still stand as markers in the book of the ages. 
 Tours of the four churches are available through the Ocean County Historical Society in Toms River. For information, call (732) 341-1880. 
 LOWER  BANK  METHODIST  CHURCH  The trustees bought the land for its construction from Levi Johnson in 1874 for $75 and the cornerstone was placed the next year. 
 GREEN  BANK  UNITED  METHODIST  CHURCH  Around 1740, the Rev. Samuel Driver came to the banks of the Mullica River. Clearing some acreage on its highest bank, he built a log cabin. Upon his death in 1748, his home became the local church and his burial on the land marked the beginning of the Green Bank Church and Cemetery. The current church was built in 1823 by Nicholas Sooy. He willed the church to his four sons and their descendants to be used as a Methodist church ''only and forever.'' 
 BATSTO-PLEASANT  MILLS  UNITED  METHODIST  CHURCH  The original church was constructed by Scottish Covenanters (Presbyterians), who settled at Pleasant Mills. According to the Scottish tradition, the church was the first structure built in town and was put up between sunrise and sunset the same day. 
 The original church was a log cabin with thatched roof and a packed earthen floor. It was replaced in 1760 by Capt. Elijah Clark with a new building of squared logs, a shingled roof and a wooden floor. By 1808, the increased activity at Batsto Furnace brought about a need for more space to serve the growing village. When the first Methodist bishop of the United States, Francis Asbury, visited Batsto in 1808 he advised the congregation to rebuild and enlarge the church. Construction was completed in r 1808, and the church has been in use since then. 
 NEW  COLUMBIA  (NESCO) UNITED  METHODIST  CHURCH  This church was built in 1847 on land donated by Jesse and Sarah Richards of Batsto. 
 The next tour is scheduled for Sept. 15. The cost is $35.

 Indonesia's top military commander, disputing reports of thousands of deaths in East Timor, said today that fewer than 100 people had been killed in the violence in the province. 
 ''The number of victims that we have recorded since the announcement of the result of the referendum is roughly in the 90's,'' said the commander, Gen. Wiranto. ''That is the number we have recorded so far, but it is not the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands as reported by the foreign media,'' he told the Indonesian Parliament. 
 General Wiranto's estimate is much less than those of pro-independence groups, which put the death toll at anywhere from 900 to 7,000. And it drew a skeptical response from the United Nations, which sheltered hundreds of refugees in the capital, Dili, before abandoning its compound."

 Gov. George W. Bush and Senator John McCain sparred tensely in a Republican debate here tonight over what kind and what size of tax cut the country could afford, with Mr. McCain ridiculing Mr. Bush's stated fear that Washington would gorge itself on the growing surplus if the money was not returned to taxpayers. 
 ''You don't understand the role of the president of the United States,'' Mr. McCain told Mr. Bush, turning to face him. ''The president of the United States will veto bills -- will veto bills -- that spend too much.'' 
 In a voice that seemed to chide and belittle Mr. Bush, Mr. McCain added, ''That's what being president of the United States is all about.'' 
 Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain have been feuding over taxes for days now, their language growing increasingly intense. Mr. Bush, the Texas governor, has proposed a $483 billion tax cut over five years that reduces tax rates for people at all income levels; Mr. McCain, of Arizona, maintains that saving some of that money to pay down the national debt is more important than giving wealthy Americans relief. 
 Mr. McCain is scheduled to lay out his own detailed tax plan on Tuesday. 
 Their quarrel on the topic tonight was actually one of the few instances that Mr. McCain, the principal challenger to Mr. Bush for the Republican presidential nomination, sharply criticized the front-runner, but Mr. Bush's other rivals took additional swipes at him on a variety of fronts. 
 Steve Forbes attacked Mr. Bush for a broken pledge, made in his 1994 campaign for governor, not to raise sales taxes in Texas. Gary L. Bauer repeatedly pressed Mr. Bush to defend his desire to promote freer trade with China, given its history of human rights abuses. 
 And Mr. Forbes, setting his sights on Mr. Bush for a second time, challenged him to make three pledges about what he would do if he became the Republican nominee and, beyond that, the American president. 
 Mr. Forbes wanted Mr. Bush to promise that he would select a running mate who opposed legal abortion, appoint Supreme Court justices with that same position and keep that position intact and undiminished in the party platform. 
 Mr. Bush declined, but without ever using that word, in one of several answers that sought to evade conflict or specificity. 
 ''I'm going to pick a vice president who can be the president,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I'll pick judges who strictly interpret the Constitution.'' He added that he would ''work to keep the Republican Party pro-life.'' 
 Mr. Forbes responded: ''It's a typical hedge. Where's the pledge, not a hedge?'' 
 Mr. Bush said, ''I don't know how I can be more clear.'' 
 Mr. Bush frequently tried to defuse the attacks on him with humor, getting off a number of good jokes that drew robust laughter from the audience at Calvin College, where the debate was held. For example, he thanked Mr. Forbes for a question that assumed that Mr. Bush would be the nominee. 
 With time ticking rapidly away before the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 24 touch off a rapid-fire series of state contests that could well yield a nominee by early March, Mr. Bush's rivals were in part looking to inflict some last-minute damage. 
 But they also seemed, at times, to be trying to lock him into conservative positions before he proceeded to a general election contest. Mr. Bush would not let that happen, carefully avoiding any commitment or statement that might come back to haunt him. 
 Except for their squabbling over taxes, Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain demonstrated remarkable amity toward each other. Twice Mr. Bush answered a question by praising, and agreeing with, the response Mr. McCain had just given, including Mr. McCain's vow never to negotiate with terrorists. 
 And at one point, they clasped hands and held them aloft as they agreed not to run any negative advertisements about each other. That gesture followed Mr. Forbes's refusal to make a similar resolve. 
 ''If being negative is telling the truth, I will continue to tell the truth,'' Mr. Forbes said. ''People deserve it.'' 
 Mr. Bush replied, ''I'll run positive ads. And I'm darned sure not going to do to candidates what this man did to Bob Dole in 1996.'' 
 The pledge that Mr. Forbes mentioned, and which is highlighted in a television commercial that he began airing last week, concerns a document from 1994 that bears Mr. Bush's signature and promises not to raise the sales tax in Texas. The debate opened with a discussion of that commercial. 
 Mr. Bush's advisers have not denied the document's authenticity, nor did Mr. Bush. Mr. Bush indeed raised the sales tax in Texas, but he explained tonight that the overall changes in the tax codes in Texas in his years as governor amounted to a $3 billion cut, not an increase. 
 Mr. Forbes said to him, ''A pledge should not be used as a trinket to win the election. 
 ''I think that's what makes American people cynical about politics: pledges are made and then quickly forgotten after the election.'' 
 Mr. Bush replied, '' One thing that makes the American people cynical is negative advertising on TV. 
 ''I am a tax-cutting person,'' said Mr. Bush, whose proposal for a tax cut has become the centerpiece of his campaign in New Hampshire, which holds its primary on Feb. 1. ''I know how to get it done.'' 
 For much of the first third of the 90-minute debate, which featured all six of the Republican candidates for their party's nomination, it was all taxes all the time, regardless of what the question was, to the point where it became a running joke. 
 There was an even sharper exchange between Mr. Bush and Mr. Bauer on the subject of American trade with China. 
 Mr. Bush had said he did not support trade with Cuba because of the repressive, Communist government of its leader, Fidel Castro. Mr. Bauer countered, saying Chinese officials were equally repressive. 
 ''Governor, you just made the case for withdrawing most-favored-nation status for China,'' Mr. Bauer said. 
 Mr. Bush shot back, ''I did not.'' 
 Mr. Bauer said, ''Everything you just said about Cuba applies to China.'' 
 Mr. Bush, however, insisted there was a ''huge difference between trading with an entrepreneurial class, like that which is growing in China, and allowing a Fidel Castro government to skim capital monies off the top of capital investment.'' 
 One of Mr. Bush's funniest comments, but also one of his oddest, came when he was asked about the professional baseball player who made racist comments and the decision by the Atlanta Braves to give him psychological counseling. 
 Mr. Bush said he agreed with that action. And when the questioner started to pose a follow-up that began by citing a Harvard University professor, Mr. Bush cut her off. 
 ''Consider the source,'' he said mischievously, to copious laughter. ''If she had said a Calvin professor, I would have been listening.'' 
 Mr. Bush attended the business school at Harvard University several years after he graduated from Yale University. 
 The debate, broadcast nationally on MSNBC, was the third time in just five days that the suddenly debate-mad Republicans had shared a stage. The dense cluster of encounters reflected the intensifying pace of the campaign for the nomination, with the first state contest, the Iowa caucuses, just two weeks away. 
 But this was the first Republican debate in Michigan, which holds its primary, a potentially pivotal one, on Feb. 22. 
 Correction:  January 12, 2000, Wednesday  An article yesterday about the Republican presidential primary debate in Grand Rapids, Mich., referred incorrectly to an action by Gov. George W. Bush on a Texas sales tax. Mr. Bush proposed an increase as part of an overall plan for a tax cut, but the sales tax proposal was not passed and Mr. Bush did not raise the tax."

 IMAGINE, if you can, the spectacle of Mae West playing Norma Desmond in ''Sunset Boulevard.'' 
 That possibility, reported by Cameron Crowe in his book ''Conversations With Billy Wilder,'' must seem incomprehensible to anyone who treasures Gloria Swanson's sinuously macabre performance in the 1950 classic. Was Mae West some kind of joke? Apparently not. But even if Mr. Wilder initially intended ''Sunset Boulevard'' to be an outright comedy, it is difficult to see how he might have used an actress who possessed such a limited, if vivid, professional persona. 
 We'll never know. Mae wasn't interested in the Wilder project because, it seems, she didn't want to play a faded movie star. She knew her fans would never believe it. Though she was then in her mid-50's, and no longer in demand by the film studios, she felt she was still in the bloom of her youth, successfully touring with ''Diamond Lil'' from time to time and discovering new fans on the nightclub circuit. 
 She was then someone recognized and/or sought out by such as Cecil Beaton, Colette and Sacheverell Sitwell. In his admiring review of her 1949 revival of ''Diamond Lil,'' Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times was moved to acknowledge what he called, in an uncharacteristically poetic effusion, ''the sublime fatalism of the entire business,'' going on to ask, ''Is she kidding or is she serious?'' 
 Mae West had become an institution, which is dangerous. 
 Today it seems that Mr. Wilder's vision of Norma Desmond in the stout form of Mae West was nothing less than prescient. Gloria Swanson may have acted Norma Desmond, but Mae West lived the character, far longer and far more successfully than Mr. Wilder, in the late 1940's, might have imagined. 
 That's one of the subsidiary revelations of ''Dirty Blonde,'' the nervy, exceptionally entertaining Off Broadway production that contemplates the legacy of Mae West in a format that mixes comedy and song to suggest that life, after all, is very much like a revue. Unfortunately, ''Dirty Blonde'' plays its last performance today at New York Theater Workshop, but don't despair. There are expectations it will soon transfer either to Broadway or to another Off Broadway house. It deserves an afterlife. 
 So does the season's second Mae West tribute: the Hourglass Group's pocket-size but exuberant Off Off Broadway revival of ''Sex,'' West's 1926 comedy-melodrama, which ends its run tomorrow in the tiny theater at the Gershwin Hotel. 
 ''Sex'' is notorious in Broadway history for having been labeled ''a public nuisance'' by the New York police and closed down, even though it had already played 41 weeks of sold-out performances without incident. In the trial that followed, Mae was found guilty and sentenced to serve 10 days in the Women's Workhouse on Welfare (now Roosevelt) Island. She received great publicity from the trial, but at a certain cost. The publicity also scared New York theater owners from booking her latest production, ''The Drag,'' a male drag show that, reportedly, was the real target of the attack on ''Sex.'' 
 ''Dirty Blonde'' is wise and moving and seemingly effortless in the way that it evokes the life, times and manners of Mae West. The work is a seamless collaboration between Claudia Shear, the star and author of her own autobiographical play, ''Blown Sideways Through Life,'' and James Lapine, the playwright, director and frequent theatrical partner of Stephen Sondheim. Ms. Shear and Mr. Lapine together ''devised'' the show, which was written by Ms. Shear, directed by Mr. Lapine, and is being acted by Ms. Shear, Kevin Chamberlin and Bob Stillman. 
 The result is a comic enchantment about two klutzy New Yorkers: Jo (Ms. Shear) and Charlie (Mr. Chamberlin), whose unusual relationship begins when they meet at Mae West's mausoleum in the Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn. Each is a seriously dedicated fan, though Charlie has the edge over Jo. 
 AS a teenager on a summer vacation in Los Angeles, he came to know the ancient Mae in her Ravenswood apartment, her home from the early 1930's until her death in 1980. Briefly, Charlie was accepted into her small, sealed world, where she lived her days in perpetual twilight (the sun did terrible things to her skin), attended by hangers-on from the old days. 
 Mae liked nothing better than to spend hours leafing through Charlie's Mae West scrapbooks; on a special occasion, the queenly bee and her drones might go out to eat Chinese, being driven to and from in her Bentley. 
 ''Dirty Blonde'' moves swiftly in and out of the lives of Mae (also played by Ms. Shear) and her various male attendants (played by Mr. Chamberlin and Mr. Stillman), and the contemporary trials of Jo and Charlie. One of Jo's comic/sad epiphanies about Mae: ''She never saw Paris . . . but she could have.'' 
 At first, Mae's obsession with self and climbing to the top is seen as funny, as when we're told that her mother once advised her, ''Don't be selfish, think of your career.'' Only later, as Jo and Charlie gain some understanding of their own lives, do they begin to see Mae in perspective. The show's final image, which shouldn't be described, is as eccentric as it is triumphant, though in a very unusual way. 
 The Hourglass Group's production of ''Sex'' is something else: a chance to see the three-act play more or less as it was presented with music interludes in 1926, but also framed with quotations taken from the court proceedings against it. Elyse Singer is the director of the first-rate cast headed by Carolyn Baeumler in the Mae West role. 
 Mae not only starred in ''Sex'' as Margy LaMont, an upwardly mobile whore with a heart of gold, but she also took credit as the playwright. According to Emily Wortis Leider's biography ''Becoming Mae West,'' ''Sex'' has its origins in ''Following the Fleet,'' a play by J. J. Byrne that Mae bought and rewrote in collaboration with the uncredited Adeline Leitzbach -- Mae never shared credit easily. What distinguishes ''Sex'' from other so-called exploitation plays of the time is Margy LaMont's brazenly untroubled attitude toward her profession. 
 Mae always said she was too nervous to read, so it is unlikely that she ever had contact with George Bernard Shaw's ''Mrs. Warren's Profession.'' Yet she would seem to agree with Shaw that prostitution, while not something to be celebrated, should be understood as a natural consequence in a society that denies women their economic rights and encourages their ignorance. 
 In the introduction to ''Three Plays by Mae West,'' published by Routledge, Lillian Schlissel, the editor, notes that at the end of ''Sex,'' Margy LaMont ''is neither saved or reborn.'' 
 She continues, ''There is no spiritual redemption . . . The ethical arithmetic is redrawn -- the wages of sin are reduced from mortal transgression to misdemeanor.'' 
 This is what scared Broadway and then delighted the movie audiences in the early years of the Great Depression. 
 When Mae went to Hollywood, her good humor and bold assumption of sexual authority, coupled with her raunchy aphorisms of Wildean balance, transformed her into one of the world's biggest box-office attractions. She was also the reason Hollywood overhauled the Production Code, the apparatus by which the industry censored its own material, in this way to combat the new licentiousness represented by little Mae. 
 Her first three movies, ''Night After Night'' (1932), ''She Done Him Wrong'' (1933) and ''I'm No Angel'' (1933), are stuffed with the grand doubles-entendres that she never tired of recycling for the rest of her life. It's in ''I'm No Angel'' that she plays a lion tamer who sticks her head into the big cat's mouth, prompting an admirer to say significantly, ''She's safer in that cage than she is in bed.'' This is the same movie in which she enunciated as her dictum about men: ''Find 'em, fool 'em, 'n forget 'em.'' Which, in 1933, was her variation on what men, especially the sort whom Mae admired most, were supposed to say about women. 
 Yet by the end of the 1930's, Mae's movies were no longer sure-fire box-office hits. It wasn't only because the Production Code was sanitizing her material. Her range was limited and she was repeating herself. She might have gone on forever as the supporting character actress she was in ''Night After Night,'' but she couldn't resist playing the star. When she hogs the screen a certain monotony creeps into her work; it soon seems as if she is imitating herself. 
 A further problem was her age. Mae started late in Hollywood; she had her 40th birthday while shooting ''I'm No Angel.'' Her ample figure was less easily disguised in contemporary clothes than in the sort of gowns worn by Lillian Russell, but she couldn't confine her films to tales set in the Gay Nineties. 
 Mae West isn't forgotten today, but she is probably best remembered in oblique ways, in association with other things, like the busty life jackets that World War II servicemen nicknamed for her. She is still recalled by occasional impersonators, some of whom are more bizarre than others. Following the murder of JonBenet Ramsey, there was a news photograph of the child wearing the sort of feather boa and cartwheel hat that Mae sported in ''She Done Him Wrong.'' 
 Mae's films still can be found in video rental shops, of course. Yet I suspect that the one rented most frequently is ''My Little Chickadee.'' This 1940 comedy-western about a hooker and a card shark is not, strictly speaking, a true Mae West movie, having been stolen by the nimble, white-gloved digits of W. C. Fields, her larcenous co-star. 
 Mae made three films after ''My Little Chickadee,'' but she might as well have retired then and there. Fields -- no gallant gentleman he (as Mae well knew) -- damaged her reputation in subtle ways that, for lethal effect, equaled the destruction wreaked on her pictures by the Production Code. 
 Fields didn't try to clean up her act; he did something far worse: he made Mae, the laid-back, self-mocking good-time girl of ''She Done Him Wrong'' and ''I'm No Angel,'' look not only humorless but mean and spiteful. Though Mae, playing Flower Belle, sets up the elaborate gag that transforms ''My Little Chickadee'' into one of the funniest movies ever made, the way the gag works out demolishes Mae's public persona. 
 To escape Cuthbert J. Twillie (Fields), who believes he has conjugal rights, Flower Belle puts a goat in the bed of their bridal suite, blows out the lamps and leaves the room in darkness. Twillie enters from the bathroom and climbs into bed, noting, after a decent pause, that Flower Belle seems to be sleeping in her caracul coat. ''Better take it off, dear,'' says Twillie with concern, ''you won't feel the good of it when you go out. . . .'' When the goat lets out a long ''m-a-a-a-a!,'' Twillie is sent into paroxysms of bliss. ''The sweet little dear,'' he says, ''is calling for her mama. Such blind innocence. . . .'' 
 THE sequence is priceless, but it also has the effect of making Mae West appear to be frosty and completely out of touch with her co-star, which she was. Mae was not a team player. But then she knew enough to realize that the character she always played, Superhooker, couldn't stand too much realism. When actual joy, passion or even humiliation are evident, the Superhooker appears ridiculous, like Miss Piggy in an otherwise conventional adaptation of ''Little Women.'' Mae took top billing in ''My Little Chickadee'' but she wound up sandbagged by Fields. 
 Both ''Dirty Blonde'' and the revival of ''Sex'' remind us of the genuine good humor and common sense that were the basis of Mae West's art, which today survives in recognizable form only in her first three films. All the others are -- to greater or lesser degrees -- imitations. 
 In a category of its own is ''Sextette,'' Mae's last movie, which opened in New York in 1979 when she was nearing 86. The film is Mae's equivalent to the biblical epic about Salome in which Norma Desmond intends to make her return to the screen in ''Sunset Boulevard.'' Mae's film is a sex comedy, based on a play she had written some years earlier, about a world-famous movie star and the attempts of her former husbands and lovers to prevent her from consummating her sixth marriage. 
 I'm embarrassed to admit that, at the time the film opened, I took a dim, rather puritanical view of it and of Mae, pointing to the age of the star and to the infirmities she shared with the production. You didn't have to be a wit to find a few laughs at her expense. 
 Now, having seen ''Sunset Boulevard'' a year ago and, much more recently, ''Dirty Blonde'' and ''Sex,'' I feel quite differently. There is no desire to sit through ''Sextette'' again, but bully for Mae for having got the screenplay onto the screen, directed by Ken Hughes (one of whose earlier epics was ''Cromwell''), with a cast including Tony Curtis, Ringo Starr, Timothy Dalton and Regis Philbin. 
 In Mr. Wilder's satiric Gothic romance, the 50-year-old former movie star shoots her screenwriting collaborator-lover and goes mad. In real life, Mae West was equally obsessed with the public personality she had created, but she wasn't nuts. She made her movie and, a year after it came out, died without melodramatic incident, at the age of 87.

"318","Revitalized UPN Is at Center of a Struggle for Ownership",1183595,"|business",13,3,2000,"20000313T000000",NA," 
 A year ago, UPN was left for dead -- a ratings failure, the sixth among six networks. 
 Then the World Wrestling Federation dived in over the ropes and reinvented the network, giving it a viable and potentially lucrative identity: the network of the young male viewer. 
 Now the future of UPN -- a 50-50 partnership between Viacom and Chris-Craft Industries -- looks promising. But the network is embroiled in a battle that extends from the partners' boardrooms to the offices of the Federal Communications Commission, involving characters like Mel Karmazin, CBS chairman; Barry Diller, USA Networks chairman; Herbert J. Siegel, Chris-Craft chairman; and Vince McMahon, the W.W.F. ringmaster. It is a battle that has implications for the proposed CBS-Viacom merger and could deal a big blow to the USA cable network. 
 Viacom and CBS want the network all to themselves or not at all. They have given an ultimatum to Chris-Craft that comes due next Monday: sell your share to Viacom or buy out Viacom. 
 Chris-Craft wants to maintain the partnership to help absorb the financial losses that continue despite the network's improving prospects. It has gone to court to stop the merger because it believes that if Viacom acquires CBS, UPN would no longer receive proper attention. 
 The legal point it is making is this: Viacom is violating a clause in the partnership agreement that Chris-Craft says forbids Viacom from making a deal with any competing network. 
 Viacom's position is that the merger is only proposed at this point, not put into effect, and therefore it never violated its noncompete deal. 
 If all that spins your head, think about this: the corporate struggle is over a fledgling network, made up of mostly weaker stations, that has piled up losses of about $800 million in the five years of its existence. 
 But one year of wrestling has done much to reverse what had been looking like a death spiral. With a two-hour block of the W.W.F. leading the way every Thursday night, UPN is showing the biggest rating gain of any network of any size this season, more than 30 percent over all but almost 200 percent among male teenagers. 
 The growth comes on what UPN executives concede is an exceedingly small base  (last year, the network had a Nielsen rating of 2 -- about two million homes -- this year, it has a 2.7) but, with wrestling at least, UPN has proved it can play with the big boys. Last Thursday, for example, the network finished just a fraction behind Fox for the night in the national ratings and easily won the night outright among those male teenagers. 
 That is significant, because young males are a group avidly pursued by advertisers selling everything from soft drinks to video games, who are willing to pay a premium to reach them. 
 And now wrestling figures as another tangled subplot to the ownership battle, with CBS and possibly other suitors lining up to try to take the W.W.F. cable programming away from the USA cable network, possibly to link up all the television rights under one corporate roof. 
 The W.W.F., which under Mr. McMahon has expanded aggressively in recent years into clothing stores and restaurants, has increasing leverage in television because of the popularity of its programs. On cable, three weekly editions of the W.W.F. events are invariably the highest-rated programs in all of cable every week. 
 Mr. McMahon recently informed USA Networks that he planned to open up the cable rights for next season to other bidders. Mr. Diller retains the right to match any competing offer, but several executives close to the deal said the offers might include elements that would be difficult to match, possibly including an equity stake in whatever channel Mr. McMahon chooses as his next partner. 
 CBS could be best positioned to negotiate with Mr. McMahon if Viacom winds up acquiring UPN outright, completes the CBS merger agreement, and gets the F.C.C. to waive its prohibition on one company operating two networks. 
 Viacom and CBS have asked for the F.C.C. waiver and many of the parties involved say there is a good chance the F.C.C. will agree, mainly to insure UPN's continued survival. One reason: UPN has become the favorite network for black viewers; about 40 percent of its audience are blacks, who watch such shows as ''Moesha'' and ''Malcolm and Eddie.'' Senior executives on both sides of the UPN ownership battle said the F.C.C. would be loath to put a network with that kind of minority following at risk. 
 Acquiring UPN could be the path to a wider wrestling deal for CBS. No CBS executive will comment for the record on the network's plans for wrestling. But another CBS unit, the cable channel TNN, is moving aggressively into this form of programming, having already acquired the rights to events like Arena Football League games and Extreme Championship Wrestling bouts. 
 Several executives familiar with both the negotiations for UPN's future and CBS's interest in wrestling tied the strategy to Mr. Karmazin. Victor Miller, a broadcast analyst for Bear, Stearns, said, ''Mel Karmazin would be very interested in operating both networks.'' 
 He said that UPN fit into Mr. Karmazin's broad strategy for reaching consumers with advertising in multiple media in all parts of their lives. This could be accomplished best by linking CBS assets, like its television network, its Infinity Broadcasting radio stations and its outdoor advertising business, with those of Viacom, like the cable channels Nickelodeon, MTV and VH-1. 
 ''You start out as a kid, you're watching Nickelodeon,'' Mr. Miller said. ''Then you get acne, you watch MTV; you get a little older, you watch UPN; so then you get married, have a couple of kids and you watch VH-1; finally you get older still and you watch CBS. And it's a fabulous lifestyle play. You start the day listening to radio and that's an Infinity station. You listen to another Infinity station on the drive to work, and while traveling you see billboards owned by Viacom/CBS. At work, you get into some streaming audio, or link into Web sites that CBS may have an interest in. Then you come home and you watch all these TV channels.'' 
 Several executives also tied the decision to trigger the buy-sell move over UPN to Mr. Karmazin, who had previously been involved in fruitless negotiations to buy Chris-Craft's broadcast interests outright. 
 ''This was Karmazin all over,'' one executive said of the deal, citing the pressure put on UPN either to agree to swallow the losses still being incurred by the network by buying out Viacom's share or to sell out for a truly modest price: $5 million. 
 But Chris-Craft hopes it will never come to that. The company requested an injunction in the State Supreme Court in New York, seeking to blow up the entire Viacom-CBS merger agreement. Chris-Craft contends that it will be irreparably damaged if it loses either the network or a deep-pocketed partner just as UPN is turning the corner and moving toward success. 
 Dean Valentine, UPN's president, said that even with the network's  turnaround this season, ''We're still going to lose money for the next year or two.'' He expressed confidence that the network's recent success can be sustained because the young male viewers it is reaching now supply much of the audience for the stations that make up the UPN network. 
 He also said UPN would tailor upcoming programs to young men, but would not limit the appeal to them. That was a mistake that the WB network has made, he said, in aiming its shows exclusively at teenage girls. ''We want to be male friendly, not male exclusive,'' he said. And he intends to retain a skew toward minority viewers. 
 ''We're not trying to be a broadcaster or a narrow-caster,'' Mr. Valentine said. ''We want to be a midcaster.'' 
 He said he expected Chris-Craft to try to retain its interest in UPN. But that may depend on whether a settlement with Viacom can be reached, or another corporate partner can be found. Chris-Craft would not be anxious to swallow the network's continuing losses alone. 
 Other suitors may appear -- Mr. Diller and his USA Networks have been mentioned in speculation about UPN's future. But for the moment, Chris-Craft wants the court to force Viacom to remain its tag-team partner. 
 Tom Wolzien, a media analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, said Viacom and CBS would not allow the UPN morass to stand in the way of their deal. ''Nothing is more important to them to get the merger closed, with or without UPN,'' Mr. Wolzien said. ''They would prefer to do it with UPN, but if it has to go away, it goes away.''

 The discussion was, for just a moment, only about basketball, merely a recitation of what Coach Mike Jarvis saw as the little weaknesses in his team's game. There had been lapses after all, and Jarvis attributes almost all of St. John's losses this season to be at its own hand. 
 ''Our greatest weakness is we go to intermission before it's intermission,'' he said. ''Everybody gets to the point that, because of faith, they think you're good enough to relax for a few minutes and take a vacation. Other than that our enemy is something we have no control over -- an injury. Injury is our only enemy. 
 ''And the N.C.A.A.'' 
 There is no such thing as single-mindedness at St. John's right now, not as it tries to simultaneously wind its way through the tricky turns of the national tournament -- beginning with its first-round game against Northern Arizona in Tucson on Thursday night -- and the even more perilous terrain of a National Collegiate Athletic Association investigation that has focused on the Red Storm's best player, Erick Barkley. 
 Jarvis faces a bizarre confluence of events. He will think as much about how his team responds to pressure defense as to the pressures of scrutiny. He will remind his team about continuing to play its quick, workmanlike style. It is when St. John's abandons that style that the team falters. 
 There is no separating basketball from the murky circumstances of the investigation now, although Jarvis concedes that the trip west will do the team some good to ''get away from this madness.'' 
 Jarvis will watch tape of the other teams and plan what defense to use to counter a 3-point-shooting machine that also features a 7-foot center in Northern Arizona. But when St. John's boards a flight this morning for Arizona, Jarvis will also tuck into his briefcase a plan for the worst case: if the N.C.A.A. finds cause to rule Barkley ineligible for a third time this season, right in the middle of the tournament. 
 ''It's sick,'' Jarvis said. ''It just seems to go against what the organization should be about. You've got to keep looking straight ahead and you can't look over your shoulder. If you keep looking back, they're going to catch you. Someone will beat you. We've got to continue to deal with the realities of the whole thing. You hope to God it doesn't happen, but you prepare for the worst. We've been doing that for months, and we'll do it as long as Erick Barkley goes to school here.'' 
 But St. John's has shown remarkable mental toughness for the last few weeks. Bootsy Thornton has even turned what is perceived as one of St. John's shortcomings -- its lack of size -- into a decided advantage. He figures that if St. John's can play only six, or occasionally seven, deep, it means that at least three of the starters will be on the floor all the time, so there will be no change in pace. 
 The players are convinced, as they have been since the N.C.A.A. began asking questions, that they can prevail, and that Barkley, in particular, can set aside his tumultuous weekend to lead them to the Final Four. 
 ''We don't even talk about it,'' Thornton said of the controversy. ''We have no other choice. It's all we can do to shut it out. The games are a relief for me. Once we're on the court, we can straight-up focus on something. I hope the worst has passed.'' 
 Center Anthony Glover concurred, although there is a note of resignation in his approach toward the N.C.A.A. investigators. 
 ''If they're going to do something, they're going to do something,'' Glover said. ''It seems like every big game we have coming up, the N.C.A.A. comes up with something. Who knows what they'll bring up Thursday?''

 THE promise of a Texas company to generate electricity on Long Island more efficiently, with less pollution and at lower cost is receiving generally positive reviews from the Long Island Power Authority and business leaders. Residents near the proposed site are more cautious. 
 The company, American National Power, wants to build a gas-fired power plant on a vacant 25-acre plot just south of the Long Island Expressway at Exit 66, in Yaphank. The facility, which could generate 580 megawatts of electricity, would be the first built on the Island by any company other than the local utility. Construction is proposed to begin next year, with completion in 2003. 
 ''I think it's an exciting idea,'' said LIPA's chairman, Richard M. Kessel. ''There is obviously a huge need for energy on Long Island, and if this plant was built, it might help us fill out the picture of how we would meet that demand.'' 
 The Brookhaven Town supervisor, Felix Grucci Jr., said the proposal ''is in concert with what I have been requesting -- alternative and competitive power on Long Island that may bring lower electric rates to the town and all of Suffolk.'' 
 The electricity would be ''significantly less expensive'' than that generated by plants owned and operated by KeySpan Energy, according to Robert J. Charlebois, vice president of American National Power. 
 KeySpan is currently the only company on Long Island that generates electricity for LIPA. It was created in May 1998 when the Long Island Lighting Company was dissolved and LIPA assumed control of its electric transmission and distribution lines and KeySpan took control of its five power plants. 
 David J. Manning, senior vice president of KeySpan, acknowledged that ''any new generating plant built today will use the most current gas-fired turbine technology.'' Keyspan's plants were initially oil-fired but were converted to allow them to burn primarily natural gas and now, Mr. Manning said, KeySpan is considering upgrading them. 
 Mitchell Palley, a vice president of the Long Island Association, said: ''This proposal is what energy deregulation means -- the ability of private companies to come in, build power plants and sell electricity at less than current suppliers. If it meets community needs, it is something we would support.'' 
 Mr. Kessel noted that LIPA buys nearly all of its electricity from KeySpan. It is able to import no more than 1,200 megawatts of electricity through five connections with suppliers off the Island. 
 On a very hot day, energy demand can reach 4,200 to 4,300 megawatts. Last July 6, in the middle of a heat wave, the demand reached a record 4,590 megawatts. The system's maximum capacity is 5,100 megawatts. 
 Bert J. Cunningham, LIPA's vice president for communications, noted that demand had increased 3.5 to 4 percent annually in the last three or four years and that it is expected to continue that pace. 
 Mr. Kessel said that he had met with Mr. Charlebois and that LIPA is now discussing integrating the electricity generated at Yaphank into the utility's grid. 
 To help meet energy demands this summer, LIPA awarded KeySpan Energy Construction, a KeySpan subsidiary, a $67 million contract on Feb. 29 to string a 138-kilovolt cable from Riverhead to Southampton by June. Energy demand on the East End has been rising sharply because of housing construction there. 
 Mr. Cunningham also noted that the utility should be awarding contracts soon to companies that bid on a proposal to build two or three power plants that would generate a total of 225 megawatts of electricity. ''The companies would build the plants at their own expense and sell the electricity to us exclusively,'' he said. 
 Another request for a proposal (R.F.P.), to lay a 600-megawatt cable under the Sound from New Haven to Shoreham, has been modified, he said, to reduce the initial capacity to 200 to 300 megawatts, but with the possibility of adding a second cable. 
 ''We are looking for flexibility in bringing electricity from off the Island,'' Mr. Cunningham said. ''We felt from the information we developed through the first R.F.P. process that it was better to look at different types of cable technologies and perhaps multiple cables.'' 
 Mr. Charlebois said his proposed plant would be a ''viable alternative'' to the cable. But Mr. Kessel pointed out that if the underwater cable were approved, it would be operational in 2002. The proposed power plant, even if it were built on time, would not be running until 2003. 
 A decision on the cable will be made by June, Mr. Kessel said. He added that he is confident that even if the cable project is approved, growing demand for power will make the American National Power project a necessity. 
 Mr. Charlebois put the cost of the Yaphank project, including the land, at about $300 million. 
 ''One of the reasons we like this site is that the closest residence is about 2,000 feet away,'' he said. ''The plant would be south of the Long Island Expressway at the intersection with Sills Road, and the majority of the homes are north of the expressway.'' 
 He noted that he has met with some civic leaders and will be sending letters to about 5,000 residents who live within two miles. 
 ''We're interested at the end of the day in designing a project that is as satisfactory as possible,'' he said. ''We are not going to go to areas where we are not welcome.'' 
 Connie Kepert, president of the Affiliated Brookhaven Civic Organizations, said that in her meeting with Mr. Charlebois, he promised to come back in the spring with more detailed information about the project's economic and environmental impact. 
 ''It certainly is important to bring competition to Long Island as far as electricity is concerned,'' she said. ''So this is a good thing. But we want to make sure that there are no environmental concerns that become a burden to the town. I know there will be an oil storage facility on the site and I'm concerned about water and air quality. I'd like to see a little more information.'' 
 Nanette Essel, co-president of the Yaphank Taxpayers and Civic Association, which represents the neighboring homeowners, raised those same concerns, saying: ''It is premature to comment before we have seen all the facts. The devil is in the details and we haven't seen any, so we have to be cautious and wait.'' 
 In its literature, American National Power writes that the project would use ''clean-burning natural gas, highly efficient electricity generating technology and cutting-edge pollution-control and water-minimization equipment. 
 ''The plant will be designed to meet the Clean Air Act's 'lowest achievable emission rate' and 'best available control technology' standards,'' the statement continues. ''Because of air-cooling technology used at the plant, the generation of a vapor plume will be almost nonexistent.'' 
 Mr. Charlebois said the plan calls for two smokestacks no higher than 180 feet. And he said the company would ''maintain as much visual buffer as possible.'' He said also that there would be no odors and that the noise from the generator turbines would not be heard 2,000 feet away. 
 American National Power estimated that 700 jobs would be created for the construction of the power plant and that another 25 full-time operators would be needed once it is erected. 
 Supervisor Grucci said that in addition to creating jobs, the project would add millions to the tax base, with much of it going to the Longwood School District. 
 ''At this point the proposal is in front of us, and when the plan becomes more real, the town will look at it,'' he said. ''But it is very much in concert with what we trying to do.''"

 ''I'M a designer,'' Anne Asensio begins, ''before being a car guy, as they say.'' 
 So it is not too surprising that General Motors, wanting to breathe new life into its cautious designs, has hired this Frenchwoman, age 37, from Renault, the French automaker whose revival has relied on attention-catching styles. 
 For the last 14 years, Ms. Asensio has been a growing influence in a Renault design team that has turned out best-selling models like the Twingo, a bright jelly bean of a car that was among the fastest-selling European small cars, and the Scenic, a bulbous van (or monospace, as the Europeans say) whose design Ms. Asensio developed. 
 Ms. Asensio would not discuss her goals at G.M., but she is expected to continue designing cars from the inside out, wrapping comfortable, expansive interiors in distinctive exteriors. 
 She has already spent time in Detroit. In 1986 and 1987, she participated in a program in product design at the Center for Creative Studies there, after obtaining a degree at the Paris School for Applied Arts and before joining Renault. But it was in France, and at Renault, that her passion for design and for cars blossomed. 
 So what made her take the offer from G.M.? ''To work internationally was an important decision for me,'' she said. ''I feel that the opportunity of going there came at the right time.'' 
 Yet her Renault ties run deep. It was while training at the company that she met her husband, Gerard, also a car designer. They have a 10-year-old son who, Ms. Asensio says, has little interest in cars. Her husband has taken early retirement from Renault and will follow her to Detroit. 
 Her interest in design goes back even earlier. She says she enjoyed a ''double education'' from her stepfather, an engineer, and her mother, whose interest in design came from her work in pret-a-porter, or ready-to-wear, fashion and who now runs her own apparel business. 
 ''First of all, I was a product designer,'' Ms. Asensio said. ''I went to cars because it's an interesting object to design. You start with the human being. And while you have to create an identity for the outside, it's a very complex object, and there are the technologies of plastic, steel, leather and the interface with the human being.'' 
 Asked what kind of car she drives, Ms. Asensio replied, ''many,'' explaining, ''My pleasure is to try cars, to change.'' On vacation, she drives a Renault Scenic or an Espace, Renault's larger van. And she loves sports cars. Her first was a Triumph TR4; she now drives a vermilion-red Porsche 911 with a black leather interior. 
 Nor is her taste limited to four wheels. A passionate biker, she also rides an Italian-built Ducati Monster motorcycle. 
 First in her pantheon of automobile designers is her mentor, Patrick le Quement, the head of design at Renault, who is highly regarded for his willingness to take risks on adventurous designs. ''I was impressed by his vision,'' she said. 
 But as a noncar type, she remains attached to other forms of design, including fashion, finding analogies in the design of complex industrial objects like cars. Though she prefers relaxed, sporty clothing, her favorite designers include Issey Miyake, whose work evolved from traditional Japanese folk costumes into avant-garde apparel employing innovative fabrics. She is also struck by the work of his young collaborator, Gwenael Nicholas, 34, a Frenchman who recently designed the interior of Mr. Miyake's Madison Avenue store. 
 But most of all she admires Alexander McQueen, the iconoclastic British designer for Givenchy, whose methods she finds akin to hers. ''He starts with a traditional design,'' she said, ''after which he tends to deconstruct, to change a little here and a little there. It's the same for cars: to change a conventional model to create a monospace, you move features gradually until you have created another world.'' 
 Her point is to start with function and comfort, not the car's shell. ''A designer doesn't start with the emotion of external design,'' she said. ''I always start with, say, kids -- how can they move and how can they travel comfortably? It's a changed point of view.'' 
 The future, she said, will bring greater attention to the needs of the elderly, as their numbers increase in Western societies. 
 Staying attuned to the future is much of what design is about, she said. ''A designer has to be very curious and open to what's going on,'' she said. ''To capture what will be the next trend. It's a special talent. You have to have an antenna.'' 
 For her, catching a whiff of the future involves being around bright, stimulating people. Though her mother's career suggested the possibility of striking off on her own, she finds that the necessary stimulation is most readily available in a corporate setting. ''It's easier to work in a large organization, where there are lots of resources and talented and interesting people,'' she said. 
 Having officially left Renault on Tuesday, she was so eager to take up her duties at G.M. that she was at the French headquarters of the company's Opel subsidiary on Thursday. 
 ''I will feel comfortable when people stop talking about Anne Asensio this and Anne Asensio that,'' she said, ''and we are working all together again, working as a team.''

 Until recently, Robert Nyantika, 30, was a strong, straight-backed police officer fighting ''shifters'' -- guerrillas and cattle thieves who make cross-border raids from Somalia. Now he is a stooped wraith unable to focus his eyes, bathe himself or walk without help. Speaking in a voice somewhere between a whisper and a song, he says his best memory is that his unit never left its wounded behind. 
 His elder brother, Omari, has the same philosophy. When he heard that Robert was deathly ill in a faraway clinic, he brought him home, already gravely thin from AIDS-related tuberculosis and diarrhea. Overworked doctors at a public Nairobi hospital were too busy or indifferent to examine Robert for a week, but Omari, a home health worker in a Nairobi slum, realized what was happening: Robert had the crippling headaches and stiff neck of cryptococcal meningitis, an AIDS complication that would blind and then kill him within two weeks. 
 The cure is fluconazole, a drug patented in most of the world by Pfizer, Inc. and commonly prescribed in America as a one-pill cure for women's yeast infections. 
 In Kenya, it costs $18 per pill, a price paid by the tiny number who can afford Nairobi's one private hospital and escape the vagaries of a national health budget that averages $5 per citizen per year. To live, Robert would need two pills a day for 8 weeks -- cost $1,080 -- and then one a day for the rest of his life -- $540 a month. His monthly earnings as a police officer were $43. 
 Robert's cure became a tiny part of the titanic struggle going on between pharmaceutical companies and public health advocates over the cost of drugs like fluconazole and who has the right to produce and market them. 
 A cheaper generic version of the drug was available and made legally in Thailand, which along with South Africa has challenged the drug companies' monopoly on their most successful products. This, they say, is the only way to save lives from the AIDS epidemic. The Thai generic, which costs only 60 cents a pill, could not be brought legally to Kenya, which like many other third world countries is only now considering whether to follow the Thai and South African challenge to the world's pharmaceutical giants. 
 But Omari knew a nurse at a foreign aid agency where doctors furious at Pfizer's pricing policy were illegally smuggling the Thai drug into Kenya. They had enough to save two lives. Robert's became one. 
 In April, when Robert began taking the pills, he was too weak to lift his hand to his mouth, but he still had courage, Omari said. 
 ''He recognizes how expensive the drugs are, and if he vomits, he throws that away,'' Omari said. ''So he really clings on. He fights to contain them.'' 
 By mid-June, Robert was alive and home in this Nairobi suburb where goats graze beside row houses and turkeys stalk up and down the dirt roads. He had survived a bout of malaria and was still skeletal, but he could feed himself, sit up and walk with help. Asked where he most wanted to go, he answered: ''Back to my place of work.'' Omari, who still helps bathe him, is slowly breaking it to Robert that this is unlikely. He is proud that his care, connections and good luck have bought his brother a few more months, perhaps even a few more years of life. 
 Setting Prices  Big Differences And Big Profits 
 Fluconazole, the best anti-fungal agent invented by modern science, is equally effective against toenail fungus, children's oral thrush and cryptococcal meningitis. It is too miraculous for the poor to live without and too profitable for Pfizer to give up. 
 Two competing forces have intensified the battle over drugs like fluconazole: the 1994 world treaty on intellectual property that underpins free trade and the AIDS epidemic of the 1990's, which is devastating whole continents too poor to pay the going rate for patented drugs. 
 The public health advocates and an increasing number of third world countries say the 1994 treaty allows them to manufacture or import much cheaper generic drugs to avert national disaster; the drug companies argue that the costs of developing drugs are so high that they cannot afford lower prices for the few that become wildly successful. 
 Pfizer first patented fluconazole in 1982 under the name Diflucan, and it will remain patented until 2004 in the United States and longer elsewhere. It is one of many drugs that put the drug companies in an awkward position: They earn their largest profits when they are prescribed for routine problems of wealthy Americans and Europeans, but they could save millions of the very poor if available and affordable. 
 To protect valuable patents, the industry has used a whole array of tactics, from aggressive lobbying to generous giveaways of millions of doses. 
 Cryptococcal meningitis attacks about 9 percent of all people with AIDS. In some countries, like Thailand, it attacks more than 20 percent. Untreated, the victims die in less than a month. 
 The wholesale prices of pills are set to recoup the costs of research, which the industry says is about $500 million per new drug, to pay for marketing, lobbying and other overhead, and to earn the huge returns that make the pharmaceutical industry among the world's most profitable. 
 Pfizer sells roughly $1 billion worth of fluconazole a year. 
 Its wholesale prices vary widely around the globe. A 1999 study by the Nobel Prize-winning agency Doctors Without Borders found them ranging from $3.60 a pill in Thailand to over $27 in Guatemala, with about a $10 average. Pfizer did not dispute the average, but said the range is smaller, from $5 in Thailand to $11 in France. The wholesale price is $6.38 in South Africa, $8.52 in Kenya and $9.78 in the United States. With retail markups, the drug may sell for $40 a pill. 
 In countries that do not honor American patents, the same drug is made by generics manufacturers. Cipla, a major Indian drug company, offers it for 64 cents a pill; Madawa Pharmaceuticals of Bangladesh for 41 cents, three Thai companies for between 30 and 70 cents. 
 Pfizer has other phenomenally profitable drugs: Lipitor, which cuts cholesterol, Zoloft for depression and, of course, Viagra. Because it is so wealthy, and yet keeps fluconazole prices high, Pfizer's critics call it a pitiless corporation that lets people die rather than cut prices or relinquish patents. 
 ''Everyone -- senior citizens, AIDS activists -- always accuses us of being profiteers,'' said Brian McGlynn, chief spokesman for Pfizer. ''And they say we'd rather give a rich white guy an erection than help an African with AIDS. 
 ''But we invest $4.7 billion in research each year, and 3 out of 10 medicines never make back their investment. And, yes, we spend a lot of money on advertising and marketing. But we don't sell soda pop. It's an enormous transfer of knowledge from our lab scientists to doctors, through those sales reps.'' 
 South Africa has the world's fastest-growing AIDS epidemic. In April, on the day that AIDS activists, unions and religious groups were set to begin a lawsuit and picketing campaign denouncing the company as an AIDS profiteer, Pfizer announced that it would supply the drug free to any South African with AIDS who could not afford it. 
 If the company expected thanks, it got almost none. 
 Act Up, the American AIDS activism group, tried to storm Pfizer's annual meeting. By June, Doctors Without Borders, which is campaigning for cheaper drugs, was accusing Pfizer of reneging on its promise. It said the company had imposed a time limit on its donation and required doctors to report back as if in a clinical trial. 
 Seeking Solutions  As Disease Spreads, More Nations Act 
 Pfizer denied this, saying the company will supply the drug free for life to every South African whose doctor says he cannot afford it, and that doctors have to report only whether their patients still take the pills and are still alive. The first free pills will not be distributed before fall at the earliest. 
 In Kenya, at a meeting in June on drug prices, officials from several African countries wondered aloud why they could not get the same deal. Dr. Jack Watters, Pfizer's medical director for Africa, said the giveaway might eventually be extended to the rest of Africa. He had already spoken with the Kenyan health authorities, he said. 
 ''If we can make it a success anywhere, we can in South Africa, because they have the best infrastructure,'' he said. Asked what the company's limit for charity was, he said, ''I really don't know the answer. 
 ''I tell the C.E.O.: 'We have 100,000 patients, they need 200 milligram pills, we don't know how long they'll live . . .' It's impossible math to do. We're not planning to stop the program, we're planning to look at it after two years.'' 
 The profits on fluconazole and other drugs allow Pfizer to give away $120 million worth of free drugs a year, including millions of free doses of its best-selling antibiotic, Zithromax, to cure eye infections in central Africa and to treat venereal disease among southern African prostitutes and mineworkers, who are central to the spread of AIDS. 
 However, many third world countries believe they cannot wait until the big pharmaceutical companies grant them charity. 
 At the June conference here, held some weeks after he had spoken to Dr. Watters, Kenya's health minister, Amukowa Anangwe, attacked profiteering, referring specifically to fluconazole. He said afterward that Kenya's Parliament was ready to pass a law allowing him to declare a health emergency when an important drug is unavailable at reasonable prices. The bill would empower him to void the drug's patent in Kenya. He could then either import cheap generic versions or use the threat to get Pfizer to lower its price. 
 More and more countries are contemplating or pursuing this path, taken already by South Africa and Thailand. 
 Until the 1990's, Thai law did not allow medicines to be patented. But the country signed the 1994 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which covers all sorts of goods. Signers become members of the World Trade Organization, an important goal for Thailand, which depends heavily on exports. 
 But one million Thais are infected with the AIDS virus, and high-priced medicines, fluconazole included, were eating up the health budget. The intellectual property laws Thailand generally defended started working against life expectancy. 
 Setting U.S. Role  Once Firms' Protector But Changing Course 
 Because fluconazole was on the market before the law changed, it was unpatentable. But under American pressure, Thailand had created a program that conferred the same market exclusivity. Pfizer put fluconazole in it and charged $7 a capsule. When the exclusivity expired in 1998, three Thai companies began to make cheap generic fluconazole. Pfizer promptly dropped its price sharply in Thailand. Thai law allows the health minister to declare an emergency and seize a drug patent. In patent law, it is known as ''compulsory licensing'' -- a company is compelled to license its secrets to a rival. 
 In practice, Dr. Korn Dabbarensi, Thailand's health minister, said in an interview, seizing a patent is usually too much legal bother; the mere threat normally gets a company to lower its prices. 
 ''Even though we're able to go ahead with compulsory licensing, we've been informed by the Ministry of Trade that we have to use W.T.O. procedures,'' Dr. Dabbarensi said. ''So we go talk directly to the drug companies in a 'humane' manner. Just one-to-one talking. But the bottom line for me is -- how 'humane' are these manufacturers? They are talking to me about the profits of their company against the lives of my people.'' 
 The 1994 global trade treaty specifically permits governments to use compulsory licensing -- not just for drugs, but for any safeguards against crises in public safety, war, health or environmental disasters. Such exceptions apply only to cure domestic emergency, and some royalty must be paid to the patent holder. 
 The Western pharmaceutical industry opposes compulsory licensing, and another practice known as ''parallel importing,'' which let a country's drug buyers seek the cheapest price anywhere in the world. Until recently, the drug companies' most powerful ally was the United States government. 
 The United States is a signatory to the 1994 protection of copyright worldwide, and has pressed other countries to pass patent and copyright laws more restrictive than its own to protect American corporations against foreign piracy. 
 In 1997, when South Africa tried to pass a law allowing the health minister to ignore the Patents Act in health crises, the United States lobbied hard against it. President Clinton raised the issue with President Nelson Mandela, the Commerce Department put South Africa on a watch list that is the first step toward trade sanctions, and a bill went through Congress making all American aid to South Africa contingent on dropping the law. 
 The South African pharmaceutical industry, which included subsidiaries of American and European companies, took the pressure much further. It closed factories, canceled investments and took out scare ads suggesting that babies could be hurt by counterfeit generic drugs. Its chief lobbyist, Mirryena Deeb, threatened to cut off all new drug discoveries to South Africa if the law passed, including AIDS drugs, cancer drugs and antibiotics. Asked in a March 1998 interview if she was literally threatening to let thousands of South Africans die, she reluctantly conceded: ''In so many words, yes.'' 
 The practices that the United States and the industry were fighting so hard were legal not only under the 1994 treaty, but also under the laws of Western countries like France and Britain. 
 The United States, too, is a big user of compulsory licensing, said Carlos M. Correa, an internationally recognized patent law expert with the University of Buenos Aires. It is a common remedy in antitrust cases and  was recently considered in the Microsoft case (it would have forced the company to license its Windows source code to rivals). 
 America's change of course came rather abruptly last year. 
 In early 1999, the Clinton administration was still squarely against South Africa's Medicines Control Act. 
 By December, the administration said it would not object if South Africa violated American law in seeking AIDS medications, as long as it abided by World Trade Organization rules. Within months, it had offered the same olive branch to the rest of Africa and to Thailand. 
 The catalyst was, apparently, a decision by the Philadelphia branch of Act Up, the gay advocacy group, to take up South Africa's cause and start heckling Vice President Al Gore, who was in the midst of his primary campaign for the presidency. The banners saying that Mr. Gore was letting Africans die to please American pharmaceutical companies left his campaign chagrined. After media and campaign staff looked into the matter, the administration did an about-face. 
 Without cheaper drugs, public health advocates say, the problems of doctors like Christopher Ouma, who works in a Nairobi public hospital where nearly 70 percent of patients have AIDS, will never be solved. 
 He recently listed drugs his hospital can never afford in sufficient quantity: Vitamins. Morphine. Warfarin for blood clots in the bedridden. Acyclovir for blinding shingles. Any anti-retrovirals, including the oldest, AZT. And, of course, fluconazole. 
 The chief killers of his AIDS patients, he said, are tuberculosis, diarrhea, pneumonia and cryptococcal meningitis. The first three are usually treatable. With the last, he said, ''we run up against a wall'' because of the price of fluconazole. 
 These patients are instantly recognizable, he says, because they moan all day. No painkiller but morphine works for them, and it is rationed. 
 ''They get no peace,'' Dr. Ouma said. ''With the intense pressure on the brain, some go blind. Most just go into a coma and die, and by then they are in such pain that it's really a blessing.'' 
 As soon as he diagnoses cryptococcal meningitis in a patient, he says, he dispenses advice he hates: If they want to be buried in their ancestral village, as most Kenyans do, they should board a bus. They have only two or three weeks to live, and the cost of refrigerated trucks ruins many families. 
 ''Can you imagine, as a doctor, having this conversation with your patient?'' he said. ''I have it once a week.''"
"328","Mayoral Candidates Tally Campaign Funds",1214943,"|new york|region",15,7,2000,"20000715T000000","|New York City"," 
 Fund-raising results released yesterday by the four major Democratic candidates to succeed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani showed that each  appeared to be accumulating war chests that would allow them to spend the most allowed under city election rules. 
 With the Democratic primary for the mayoral race 14 months away, each of the four candidates has raised at least $2.8 million in total contributions, according to the filings, which are required by the city's Campaign Finance Board to qualify for public matching funds. Although the deadline for the filings is Monday afternoon, aides to each of the candidates said they had prepared figures yesterday. 
 Coming after more than two years of aggressive fund-raising by all the candidates, the figures may have been disappointing for supporters of the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone. He reported raising $625,000 during the six months that ended July 11, less than half the $1.4 million he raised in the six months that ended in January. Mr. Vallone has raised a total of $2.8 million, and has $2.1 million left on hand. 
 ''During this calendar year, the business of government has taken up a lot of the speaker's time, and he has not been able to spend every minute dialing for dollars,'' said Adam Macy, a spokesman for Mr. Vallone's campaign. But, Mr. Macy said, ''people will start focusing on this race after the Senate race,'' and each of the four leading Democrats will have ''plenty of money.'' 
 The city comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, raised the most during the reporting period: $1.4 million, bringing his total donations to $4.9 million, according to approximate figures provided by his media consultant, Hank Morris. Mr. Hevesi has $4.6 million on hand, Mr. Morris said. 
 A close second in fund-raising over the last six months was Mark Green, the public advocate, who reported raising $1.1 million during the period.  That amount, described in a press release by his campaign staff as ''exceeding our most optimistic estimates,'' raised Mr. Green's total contributions to $3.3 million, with $2.9 million on hand. 
 Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, raised $850,240 during the reporting period, bringing his total to $2.9 million, with $2.4 million on hand, said Allen Cappelli, a spokesman. 
 Mr. Cappelli said that he expected all four of the leading Democrats to raise enough to fully qualify for matching campaign funds by the end of December. 
 The only other Democrat who has filed for the mayoral race and is seeking public matching funds, a former city councilman, Sal Albanese of Brooklyn, said yesterday that he raised $90,000 during the last six months, bringing his total to $265,000. 
 Thus far, no major Republican mayoral candidate has emerged. 
 Under the city's new campaign finance law, $1,000 in public matching campaign funds is provided to the candidates for each $250 contributed to their campaigns by individual New Yorkers, up to a limit of 55 percent of their total spending. 
 The law, which bans corporate contributions, sets a limit of $4,500 for individual contributions and caps total spending by each candidate on the mayoral primary at $5.5 million."

"331","Harcourt Seeking Approval To Operate an Online College",1223581,"|technology|education|business",19,8,2000,"20000819T000000",NA," 
 In a bid to join a handful of private companies offering college-level courses over the Internet, Harcourt General hopes to receive approval on Monday to operate an online college. 
 Harcourt General, an educational publisher based in Chestnut Hill, Mass., said its Higher Education unit had been working with the staff of the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education for 18 months to meet its standards for approval as a college, granting associate or bachelor's degrees through online classes. 
 The unit's president and chief executive, Robert Antonucci, said the company hoped to begin offering at least 80 courses in the fall and 120 by the end of the year, selling as many as 10,000 individual 12-week courses for about $900 each. The company expects to draw primarily adult students. 
 Mr. Antonucci said that ''about 50 percent'' of the course books would come from Harcourt. He said professors were free to chose, but ''when it is close we would probably go with a Harcourt book.'' Students will also have access to an online library of electronic journals and books. 
 Harcourt has hired 4 full-time faculty members and about 30 adjunct faculty members in four schools: health and science, business, information technology and arts and science. ''It will be a full-service college, except without bricks and mortar and without professors in classrooms,'' Mr. Antonucci said. 
 Students will join classes with about 10 members, each led by a professor who posts lecture notes and assignments on the Internet. Discussions with the professor and other students will take place by e-mail at the students' convenience. 
 Another Harcourt unit already provides college courses by mail to about 400,000 students through a correspondence school licensed by Pennsylvania that Harcourt acquired in 1997 when it bought the National Education Corporation. Mr. Antonucci said Harcourt had spent more than $10 million over the last two years developing its online curriculum. Mr. Antonucci previously served as the Massachusetts education commissioner. 
 A few other companies already offer full college degrees over the Internet, including the University of Phoenix, Jones International University and Capella University. The financier Michael R. Milken is building an online higher education company called Knowledge Universe."

 It might take a magnifying glass to spot him, that man in a navy-blue suit, his chest puffed out, among 180 other world dignitaries in the official photograph of the United Nations Millennium Summit group. But he is there, right next to the foreign minister of Niger, and he is not supposed to be. 
 The photograph was meant to be taken of heads of state attending an extraordinary, three-day summit meeting called to thrash out problems of poverty and peace at the United Nations. 
 The man in the upper left corner is Count Carlo Marullo di Condojanni, of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta -- no current ties to the country of the same name -- which claims to be the smallest stamp-issuing authority in the world. It is based in Rome, just west of the Spanish Steps. And it is not a nation. 
 ''He probably got lucky,'' said Hans Grohmann, a United Nations protocol assistant. 
 The photograph was taken in a council chamber in the United Nations shortly after a luncheon of world leaders on Wednesday. Many of the leaders were accompanied to the chamber by fellow delegates, and that was probably how the count managed to end up in the photograph, Mr. Grohmann said. Two other countries, Jordan and Norway, also violated the rules by having two representatives each in the photo. 
 Count di Condojanni was the official delegate from his order to the summit. Like the International Red Cross, the group has representation at the United Nations, even thought it is not a nation. It was founded in 1048 as the Knights Hospitalers of St. John of Jerusalem by businessmen from Amalfi, south of Naples. Their goal was to build a hospital to serve pilgrims from the Holy Land. 
 As of the late 1980's, the group had 3,000 Italian members and 2,000 Americans. It now runs 200 hospitals and clinics worldwide. Since 1966, it has issued more than 300 stamps with distinctive designs that chronicle the order's history of military and charitable works. 
 The order's mission to the United Nations could not be reached last night. 
 But looking closely at the photo, is that a widening grin on Count di Condojanni's face?"

 For more than a century, the Citizens Union has been a steady, evenhanded voice for improving city government through public education. 
 While the union's goals have not changed, its tools for promoting political engagement have. In August 1999, it started a Web site that offers ''one-stop shopping for people who care about public policies and politics in New York City,'' said Conn Nugent, the group's executive director. 
 The Gotham Gazette, published online each weekday, features thoughtful essays on topics varying from arts to zoning and provides useful resources for both policy devotees and novices. 
 Mr. Nugent, who shared the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize for his work with International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, writes a regular column on the day's top news. 
 A staff of three keeps the site topical and balanced with the help of 50 regular contributors, who include elected officials, judges and directors of nonprofit groups. William F. Weld, former governor of Massachusetts, wrote a recent essay on government reform, for example, and Bette Midler gave an assessment of the city's community gardens. 
 ''Our ideology is very simple,'' Mr. Nugent said. ''The best citizenry is an engaged citizenry.'' 
 WHAT YOU SEE -- The home page looks like the front page of a newspaper, with Mr. Nugent's column and links to the day's commentary, letters to the editor and the like. The Gazette also features an in-depth examination of an issue each day and ''Ask Mother Knickerbocker,'' a column on New York City lore. Other recent items have included maps, created by the New York Public Interest Research Group, on the citywide distribution of school-age children, tuberculosis cases and heroin usage.

 AT first blush, the Hudson Valley Children's Museum looks like a sprawling child-care center. With its low ceilings and fluorescent lights, the space lacks the visual drama one expects from a museum. Scuff marks on the walls and peeling exhibits suggest that the place needs a top-to-bottom makeover. 
 But the museum, which draws 40,000 visitors a year to Nyack, in Rockland County, is focusing its attention elsewhere -- namely on a much bigger, snazzier space it plans to build up the Hudson River in the village of Haverstraw. It is now negotiating with elected officials there who are eager to have the museum move to a riverfront site at the foot of Main Street. The museum's administrators envision a whimsical, architecturally significant structure, four times the size of the current one, that would take full advantage of the spectacular vistas at the widest point of the Hudson River. 
 In the meantime, the somewhat tattered appearance of the museum is quickly forgotten the moment a child engages the ingenious and playful displays. 
 I recently brought my 2-year-old daughter, Amelia, to the museum, along with our au pair, Carly de Beer. As we approached the entrance, I joked that if the museum failed to elicit a single ''wow,'' it would have failed, since that was Amelia's expression du jour. I need not have worried. There was a steady stream of them as she tackled the exhibits and activities, which seemed designed to entertain, provoke and stimulate any number of age levels. 
 One of the first things you encounter -- and certainly the quirkiest -- is an orange 1966 Citroen 2CV, whose dashboard is stripped of everything except the steering wheel. The roof and doors are missing, too, which made it easy for me to watch as Amelia, an avid driver, went vroom. 
 Next, we checked out the bubble station, which lifted the concept of a soap-dipped wand to new heights. The ''wands'' in one soap-filled basin were clothes hangers and those green plastic strawberry containers. The hangers didn't work so well, but Carly blew a wonderful mound of bubbles with the strawberry basket. Another device that amazed Amelia was a ''bubble wall,'' an iridescent sheet achieved by pulling apart two long bars drenched in soap. At another bubble contraption, you step onto a platform surrounded by a large hoop marinating in soap. When you pull on a rope, the hoop rises, enclosing you in a giant ''bubble tunnel.'' Unfortunately, the tunnel kept bursting when the hoop reached two feet, apparently because the marinade did not have enough soap. (Or maybe the device was purposefully amiss, so that older children might generate just such a hypothesis.) 
 Off we went to the ''creation station,'' a budding artist's dream studio, filled with pint-size tables and shelves bursting with paints, brushes, crayons, Magic Markers, stacks of paper, feathers, sequins, glue and clay. Parents will love the basket of smocks and the fact that this messy flurry of activity is not happening at home. 
 After dashing off a quick work of Abstract Expressionism, Amelia was headed for the dinosaur room, where she seized on one of three large rubber eggs in a nest on the floor. One of the more effective displays was a life-size cast of an actual Nanosaurus skeleton, a dwarf lizard found in Utah. The museum staff cleverly simulated the delicate process of uncovering fossils by scattering dry rice over the cast and providing two soft brushes. A panel explained that ''scientists find fossils by digging in the earth and exposing dinosaur bones that have been turned to stone by the weather'' and the passage of time. While the message may have been lost on Amelia, she greatly enjoyed pushing around the rice. 
 Surprisingly, the one room aimed at her tender age seemed to hold the least interest, maybe because it contained many of the things Amelia sees on a daily basis, like toy phones, plastic animals, blocks and books. They could never compete with the museum's fish tank or the giant kaleidoscope or the mock submarine leading to a Hudson River exhibit or the wavy mirrors that make you look three feet tall or, in her case, a foot and a half tall. 
 But nothing drew a reaction quite like the giant doll house behind glass, whose rooms and appliances lit up and whirred while a narrator talked about conserving energy. Five dogs watched television in the den. In the kitchen, a turkey popped out of the refrigerator to illustrate one of the house's biggest energy gobblers (get it?). In the laundry room, Mommy pedaled a stationary bicycle, while Daddy applied weatherstripping to the front door with a staple gun. 
 ''Wow!'' exclaimed Amelia, her curls flying as she jumped up and down. ''Wow! Wow! Wow!''

 Color Is Everything 
 Q.  I have been longing to own a yellow flowering clivia for years but they have been far too expensive for me. I wonder if the price has gone down at all, and if you can enlighten me as to the availability of these plants? 
 A.  Depending on when you looked last, the price has gone down, but clivia with yellow flowers instead of the more common orange still cost between $100 and $750 for a blooming-size plant. How one responds to prices like that illustrates the difference between a longing and a true obsession. 
 Why so pricey? When you cross-pollinate two naturally occurring yellow forms of clivia, you don't know what the flowers will look like for four or five years. If cross-pollination is successful, you propagate by division, and it's another few years before the divisions are ready to be divided again. When you have a few extras to sell, the demand from collectors is high, and a clivia like Yellow Chiffon is worth $750 because of its rarity. By the time you have enough to sell inexpensively, you may have forgotten why you went into horticulture in the first place. 
 Japanese breeders are working on tissue-culture propagation, which will greatly increase the supply. In the meantime, you can buy the seeds for yellow flowering clivia for about $17 for two seeds. But there is a small chance that the seeds won't come true to their parents, and won't have yellow flowers. 
 Yellow clivia plants are available from Louisiana Nursery, 5853 Highway 182, Opelousas, La. 70570, (337) 948-3696, catalog $6. Seed sources include Park Seed, 1 Parkton Avenue, Greenwood, S.C. 29647, (800) 845-3369, free catalog. 
 Privet Pests 
 Q.  I have a 40-foot-long hedge of shrubs whose name I don't know. The leaves are roughly oval and shiny. For the last couple of years I have noticed little white spots on the bark. Then this summer, around mid-July, I noticed that the leaves were starting to drop in one section about six feet wide, and eventually those bushes lost all their leaves. Their stems and branches were coated with white, which I was told was scale. One thing or another delayed me from addressing the problem over the summer, and I wonder if I can do something about it now? And is it OK to prune the diseased branches back at this time of year? 
 A.  Your privet hedge, and possibly any neighboring lilac, ornamental cherry or plum, is being attacked by white prunicola scale, an insect that comes with armor plate. Fighting it can be a bit trickier than fighting other insects. 
 For most of their lives, when they are eggs or feeding adults or are quietly passing the winter, scale stay put right where they are, protected by a hard outer shell. There's not much of a view, but as real estate agents say, location is everything. Because scale are soft-bodied insects, the shell serves them well against predators, including sprayer-wielding homeowners. 
 The key to controlling scale insects is to get at them when they are in their vulnerable crawler stage, looking for a juicy branch to settle on, erect a scale bungalow, and lay a few eggs. That means late April to early May for the generation that overwinter on the branches, and mid-July to early August, when the second generation's crawlers emerge to look for their own spot. 
 Horticultural oil (see the label for the proper dilution depending on the season) is very effective against crawlers because it both smothers them and is absorbed by their cells, where it wreaks havoc with their metabolisms. But when they are under their covers they just laugh off anything you throw against them. Don't waste your efforts (or your horticultural oil) now; wait for next spring. 
 Pruning should wait until late March or early April, before new growth begins. During the winter the insects are dormant, so no further damage is being done."
"339","Sports of The Times; Mets Seem Outsiders In This Showdown",1242079,"|sports",26,10,2000,"20001026T000000",NA," 
 THIS was in late March, when Benny Agbayani heard rumors he might be sent down. He was with the Mets in Japan, a long way from home for most of the players but close to the Pacific center of Agbayani's soul. 
 He had a meal with Konishiki, a Samoan who grew up in Hawaii and became the first non-Japanese wrestler to achieve the second highest honor in sumo, called Ozeki, or champion. 
 ''He told me, 'Don't give up,' '' Agbayani recalled. ''He told me to stay focused, not to let them get me down.'' 
 The advice from the retired sumo star would apply to these Mets, who have been so much fun but are currently in very big trouble in their own ballpark, both in the score department and the ovation department. 
 The Yankees outscored them, 3-2, last night, and came embarrassingly close to winning the battle of the decibels, too. Now the Mets will need a victory tonight or disperse for the winter. 
 ''It's going to be tough, but we can't just run away,'' Agbayani said afterward. 
 The Mets have been a work in progress all season, with players like Agbayani and Jay Payton emerging from the logjam of outfielders, but now they need a vintage Mets' World Series rally against a championship team. 
 ''They've lost three straight before,'' said Payton, Agbayani's best friend on the team. ''And we've won three straight. We'll just have to grind it out, get down and dirty.'' 
 These two friends have shown their own strength, surviving with the Mets from those tenuous opening days in Tokyo, when it seemed the front office was intent on farming out Agbayani for the simple clerical detail that he had options left. 
 Imagine if they had lost Benny Agbayani back then. Imagine if he had let them break him down. Instead, he has been responsible for the Mets' being in contention in all three of their losses. He is batting .286 and last night he went hitless, including a wicked line drive that the pitcher, Jeff Nelson, converted into a double play to end the sixth. 
 On Tuesday, Agbayani brought the Mets back to life with his ringing, liberating double scoring the go-ahead run. After the game, he recalled that meal with Konishiki back in Tokyo. 
 Now retired, Konishiki was once considered for the highest rank of Yokozuna, but was passed over. 
 ''He's an outsider there,'' Agbayani recalled the other night. ''You have to be strong when you're an outsider.'' 
 Agbayani has a respect for sumo wrestlers that athletes have for people who perform other sports. Ken Griffey Jr., and Michael Jordan idolize golfers. Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris fancied themselves as running backs. Michael Schumacher, the Formula One auto driver, lives for his cameos in soccer uniforms. 
 And Benny Agbayani, born in the 50th state, with its roots to the east and to the west, has immense respect for the gigantic, fleshy sumo wrestlers who comport themselves with a solemn dignity unknown in American sports. 
 He followed Konishiki's advice in Tokyo and won the second game against the Cubs there with a pinch-hit grand-slam home run and then waited to see if the front office would follow through on its impending cutdown. 
 ''We had too many outfielders,'' Agbayani said. ''I was the eighth outfielder.'' 
 Agbayani was battling the perception that he was somehow too round to play regularly. At 6 feet tall and 225 pounds, he falls into the same preconceptions that Charles Barkley once encountered in basketball. 
 ''That's just my body type,'' Agbayani was saying Tuesday. ''That's how we all look in Hawaii.'' 
 He has had an advocate in Bobby Valentine, who was once his manager briefly at Norfolk, and who never wanted to send him down. Instead, Valentine thought Payton needed the extra year of seasoning to recuperate from injuries. But both have been terrific, and now must find something left for the Mets to continue. 
 The two friends were impressed with the way Mariano Rivera came in and pitched two full innings last night. 
 ''Joe Torre wasn't taking any chances,'' Payton said. ''They were counting on Rivera not giving up a run.'' 
 The insecurity of those opening days has not yet dissipated. On Tuesday afternoon, Agbayani ran into rumors that he would be benched for Darryl Hamilton against the right-handed slants of Orlando (El Duque) Hernandez. This was, in fact, a talk-radio creation, perpetuated by a few gossip-mongers in the print press. 
 ''He makes out the lineup,'' Agbayani said of the manager. ''What am I going to do, go into his room and complain?'' 
 Some people would. Instead, Agbayani decided he could live with the fictitious benching. 
 ''Whaaaat?'' asked Valentine afterward. ''It was never on my mind. Yeah, I'd platoon him during the season sometimes, but that was to get at-bats for other guys. This is the World Series. You go with the guys who got you here. I never gave it a thought. Not once.'' 
 Agbayani and Payton have a place in the lineup for this World Series. Battling stereotypes and injuries, they have come a long way, and now they will try to extend this Series, with the desperation of outsiders."
"340","Bookend; The Rising Sun Sets on Japanese Publishing",1253785,"|arts|books",10,12,2000,"20001210T000000","|Japan"," 
 Japan's popular love affair with books, though it began only in the 1880's, once more than made up in intensity whatever it lacked in longevity. A century ago, during the Meiji Restoration, a national drive to catch up to the West, literacy in Japan became universal and parents came to see producing well-schooled children as their duty to the state. Publishing for the masses took off. Japan's second great drive to excel began after the devastation of World War II, and once again book learning was at its center. Public libraries became common for the first time after the war, and during the rise to economic power the whole nation seemed to live by the maxim: save money, go to sleep early and read plenty. 
 That last injunction was promoted immeasurably by the explosive growth of rail travel. Commuting several hours every day, the Japanese reader, his book inevitably sheathed in a homemade cover, his head inclined slightly forward, fully absorbed in the text, became the second most common sight on a train -- after people snoozing, that is. 
 During the golden age of Japanese publishing, the 1950's and 60's, the number of books produced yearly soared. And authors like Yukio Mishima, Osamu Dazai, Junichiro Tanizaki and Yasunari Kawabata were not only broadly and avidly read but became important cultural icons. Literary magazines flourished too, with the influential Shincho Monthly routinely selling 100,000 copies. The debuts of new authors were occasions for national excitement. Japanese who remember this era say the measure of a person was as likely to be the books in his home as the kind of shiny new material possessions, from kitchen blenders to color televisions, that households acquired as the country grew rich. 
 Japan was already becoming known as the land of the gadget, though, and, almost inevitably, the country's love affair with literature began weakening under the relentless assault of every manner of diversion served up by consumer electronics. A train ride in Tokyo today is as good a place as any to witness the emergence of what is whimsically called the ''thumb tribe.'' These are the commuters who in the place of books now wield portable electronic games, digital assistants and, most of all, the ubiquitous cellular phone, which, both above ground and below, is used continually to send e-mail and surf the Net. 
 As electronic communications become part of everyday life around the world, the question is whether Japan and its thumb tribes are a harbinger of what lies in store for publishing elsewhere, or whether this island nation, always proud of its uniqueness, is a mere oddity. 
 In the last decade, according to publishing industry sources, total book sales in the country have fallen from 900 million copies to 700 million, while sales of ''pocket books,'' the popular paperbacks that were the staple of the commuter, have shrunk from 300 million to 230 million. ''Serious literature, that is where the sharpest decline is taking place,'' Toshiharu Sasaki, an industry expert with the Research Institute for Publications, told me. ''The publishing industry's health goes in line with the reading habits of the public, and people are reading 2 to 3 percent less every year. The way to success in this business these days is in writing easy-to-read books, with short sentences, lots of slang and easy plots.'' 
 A sampling of recently successful titles speaks volumes about what has been happening to reading in Japan. The big hits of recent seasons have been books like ''Speak Better Japanese'' or ''Things You Shouldn't Buy,'' a scattershot review of consumer products that sensibly warns the public, for example, to be wary of the medicinal value of the ''energy drinks'' sold everywhere in Japan. (Elsewhere, the book warns that a popular brand of lip balm will cause elevated cholesterol levels if eaten.) Other huge sellers have been highly sentimental stories like ''No One's Perfect,'' the autobiography of Hirotada Ototake, a man born without limbs, or ''So Please Live On,'' a memoir by a woman who was bullied in grade school, attempted suicide in junior high and married a gangster as a teenager. The story becomes an inspirational tale after the author, Mitsuyo Ohira, tells how she overcame her low self-esteem to become a lawyer. 
 One publishing executive said that the only kinds of books that really work in Japan these days are mawkish tales of triumph against adversity or stories of tawdry sensationalism. ''The Japanese like to have tears brought to their eyes,'' he told me. 
 Of course there are serious novelists still to be found making a good living from their work in Japan. Among the most successful, Haruki Murakami, Ryu Murakami (no relation), Banana Yoshimoto and the Nobel laureate Kenzaburo Oe all regularly sell hundreds of thousands of copies of their books. But the publishing executive noted that while their novels have a devoted readership, they are often bought by others more out of a sense of obligation than to be read. 
 The real beginning of literature's decline in Japan may have been the boom in manga, the hefty comic books whose readership exploded in the 1970's and 80's, spawning their own unique, and intensely popular, subculture. In the 80's the most popular manga titles averaged weekly sales of well over two million copies. At the peak of the trend, between a quarter and a third of all published material in Japan consisted of comics, with titles for every niche audience from salarymen to schoolgirls. 
 Aficionados maintain that reading manga is a serious pursuit, and that the story lines and drawings involve true artistry and sophistication. Be that as it may, they too would seem to have been knocked off their perch. Now, according to Kazuto Yamaguchi, an editor at Kodansha, Japan's largest publisher, ''even the people who used to read manga are switching to electronic diversions.'' 
 What is left in print, besides commercial books, are magazines offering young women fashion and beauty advice, as well as practical tips from finding clothing bargains to snagging that handsome office colleague who works at the distant workstation. Or, for mostly male readers, weeklies like The Shukan Post and The Shukan Gendai, which offer a strange mixture of gloss and pulp: nude pictorials, titillating social reporting and political scandal. Imagine a hybrid between Playboy and The National Enquirer, with some news coverage and People-magazine-style gossip thrown in, and you get the idea. Magazines like these have relegated the more serious journals about news and culture that once dominated postwar newsstands to the back of the racks. 
 ''In Japan, literature is no longer mainstream culture,'' commented Yoshinori Shimizu, a professor of literature and a book critic for Asahi Shimbun, Toyko's leading newspaper. ''My students have done very little reading. For them, whether it is classics or mystery novels, they are equally unknown.''

 In ''Memo to Analysts: Thanks for Nothing'' (Market Watch, Dec. 3), Gretchen Morgenson criticized market analysts for failing to anticipate problems that can prompt a stock price to fall -- using Gateway, the computer company, as a recent example. The column drew varied responses from readers. 
 To the Editor: 
 It is time that some analysts wake up and do some decent legwork on the reasons behind the companies' adjustments and restructuring charges and pay more attention to media reports on factors that affect the industries they cover. 
 Perhaps they are used to favorable reports and do not know how to recognize the reality of a company's position if it begins to slide. 
 Now the pundits are filling the media with news of a recession or worse. The pendulum swings back and forth, and the analysts continue to issue reports of ''hold,'' ''buy,'' ''strong performer,'' etc. The average investor is left at a great disadvantage by the faulty or belated advice.

 What are the odds of hearing Prokofiev's ''Zdravitsa'' (''A Toast''; to Stalin, that is) twice in New York within five years? Small enough, perhaps, to qualify as sheer bad luck. 
 Valery Gergiev did the work proud with the Kirov Orchestra and Chorus during the first Lincoln Center Festival, in 1996 at Avery Fisher Hall. And now Leon Botstein has conducted it with the American Symphony Orchestra and the Concert Chorale of New York in the same hall. 
 ''O'er the earth the rising sun sheds a warmer light,/since it looked on Stalin's face it has shone more bright,'' the text (''after folk songs'') runs. ''Much the pain that Stalin has endured/that people's welfare be secured.'' This in 1939 (for Stalin's 60th birthday), when, as Mr. Botstein points out in a program note, ''no one had any illusions about the extent of Stalin's cruelty and butchery, which involved the systematic purging, exile and murder of peasants, leading artists and intellectuals.'' 
 Why should such noxious claptrap claim attention now? Maybe the best argument that can be made -- but never quite was, in all of Mr. Botstein's talk on Wednesday of ''the larger potential role of politics and idealism, philosophy and social justice in the inspirational nexus of a composer'' -- is that the work is a historical artifact. As such, it must be preserved and contemplated, as an example of the limitless mendacity and hypocrisy on which Stalin's regime was founded, and a corrective to the reputation of a composer too often adulated (like many another artist) on the basis of his real masterpieces. 
 This is tricky business. Books, paintings, plays and scores must indeed be preserved. But performance changes everything. Whatever the reason a work may have been chosen in the first place, once the process of rehearsal and performance sets in, the object is suddenly to present the work in the best possible light. 
 So then the quandary falls to the audience: how to respond? Applaud and cheer . . . what? Not the sentiments, of course, but -- somehow -- just the music, independently of how well it conveys them? (In this case, the music is cut from some of the same attractive cloth as Prokofiev's ''Romeo and Juliet.'') Not the questionable choice of work on which to lavish such attention, perhaps, but -- somehow -- just the quality of the performance? (It was a ''good'' one, to the extent that it could be seen in abstraction.) 
 Later in Mr. Botstein's program on Wednesday -- a Russian evening, ''Forgotten Patriotisms: Music as Political History,'' in the American Symphony's seasonlong Music and Memory series -- a few catcalls followed Shostakovich's Second Symphony, a jingoist tribute to Lenin on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the 1917 revolution. (''This is our banner, the name of new generations:/October, Communism and Lenin!'') But in the Prokofiev, the audience seemed merely caught up in the excitement of a rousing conclusion. (''You the flame that quickens minds and hearts of all. Stalin! Stalin!'') What, exactly, constitutes a good presentation and performance of poisonous music? 
 If anything, Mr. Botstein's ''exercise in memory, not rehabilitation,'' afforded an opportunity to explore the nature and meaning of performance -- which is a celebration, in a sense -- but the topic never came up in the flood of words, from the preconcert lecture by Richard Wilson through the notes by Mr. Botstein and others. 
 Miaskovsky's Sixth Symphony of 1923 (harmless enough: the sort of thing Rachmaninoff might have written had he remained in the Soviet Union) crowned the evening, well executed like the rest of the program. At two hours, the evening was short by Mr. Botstein's standard, evidently allowing adequate time to rehearse relatively unfamiliar music: some of it, to be sure, no longer unfamiliar enough.

"343","New Privacy Rules Are Challenged",1256997,"|health|u.s.",21,12,2000,"20001221T000000","|United States"," 
 Leaders of the health care industry said today that they would immediately ask President-elect George W. Bush to revise new rules issued by President Clinton to protect the privacy of medical records. 
 But Clinton administration officials said broad public support for such safeguards would lead the Bush administration to accept the rules. 
 The statements suggested that far from ending a five-year battle over personal privacy, the new rules would set off a new round in the struggle between privacy advocates and the health care industry, which will take its case to the new administration and to Congress. 
 Advisers to Mr. Bush said he supported the principle of medical privacy, but would want to review the new rules. Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush transition team, said, ''As with all last-minute regulations, we will review them upon assuming the presidency on Jan. 20.'' 
 The new administration could delay or revise the privacy rules, but would need to solicit public comment before making major changes. 
 Consumer advocates vowed to defend the rules, which Mr. Clinton described as ''the most sweeping privacy protections ever written.'' But hospitals, health plans and other health care providers said they hoped the new administration would rewrite the rules to lessen the burden on their industry. 
 Mary R. Grealy, the president of the Health Care Leadership Council, an association of 50 chief executives from large health care companies, said: ''We definitely will be working with the new administration to seek a more balanced approach to protecting privacy. We are sending papers to the Bush transition team.'' 
 Ms. Grealy expressed concern about a fundamental feature of the new rules requiring doctors, hospitals and other health care providers to obtain written consent from patients before disclosing their medical information even for routine purposes like treatment or the payment of claims. That requirement was not in the proposal issued by the White House in November 1999. 
 Health care providers will have to retain such consent forms for a minimum of six years. Ms. Grealy said she worried that health care providers would have the ''privacy police'' looking over their shoulders to make sure they had the necessary forms. 
 Lawrence A. Ponemon, global leader of the privacy practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers, which advises hundreds of health care institutions, said: ''Our clients in the health care industry need to be very alarmed. Most hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies are light-years away from complying with these rules. They don't understand the magnitude of the rules.'' 
 Two Democrats, Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont and Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, applauded the rules, which are scheduled to take effect in two years, with civil and criminal penalties. Mr. Markey said he was pleased with the consent requirement and the fact that the government was covering paper records as well as electronic records. 
 ''Requiring written consent is crucial to giving patients meaningful control over the most intimate details of their lives,'' Mr. Markey said. 
 Donna E. Shalala, secretary of health and human services, said Mr. Bush would probably not change the rules. After reviewing them, Dr. Shalala said, he will see that ''we have found a proper balance'' and ''these rules have broad support.'' 
 Likewise, Sally Katzen, deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, said Congress would probably not alter the rules. 
 Melinda R. Hatton, vice president of the American Hospital Association, said, ''We want patients to feel comfortable with how their information is used, but we will ask the Bush administration to help us deal with some flaws in the regulations.'' 
 In an interview, Ms. Hatton said that at least two aspects of the consent requirement would be ''administratively cumbersome.'' Under the rules, patients may ask health care providers to restrict how medical information is used to carry out treatment, payment and ''health care operations.'' In addition, after authorizing the use of information for such purposes, patients may revoke their consent. 
 The Clinton administration said it would cost $17.6 billion over 10 years for the health care industry and employers to comply with the privacy rules. But Ms. Hatton said the cost just for hospitals could total $22 billion over five years. 
 John T. Bentivoglio, a lawyer who was chief privacy officer at the Justice Department from 1998 to last July, said: ''The new regulations are a tremendous step forward in protecting health privacy, but they are more complex than they need to be because of the underlying statute, passed in 1996. The rules cover online pharmacies like PlanetRx and drugstore.com. But they do not cover other Web sites that dispense health information over the Internet and collect data on the browsing habits of consumers.'' 
 President Clinton said the rules would limit companies' ability to obtain sensitive medical information for the purpose of marketing. ''Recently,'' he said, ''expectant mothers who haven't even told their friends the good news are finding sales letters for baby products in their mailboxes. That's wrong. Under these new rules, it will also be illegal.'' 
 Caryl F. Greaves, director of the medical records department at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, said the rules would present an immense challenge. Some patients with chronic diseases, she said, have 10 volumes of records."

"345","Bush Repeats Call for Arms Reduction and Missile Shield",1266056,"|u.s.",27,1,2001,"20010127T000000","|Russia"," 
 Treading into national security policy after a week devoted to education, abortion and tax cuts, President Bush said today that he intended to keep his campaign pledge to reduce the nation's nuclear weapons as he moved ahead with construction of a defense against ballistic missiles. 
 Mr. Bush repeated a proposal he made last spring and suggested he would proceed with reductions in nuclear warheads and the construction of a missile defense as a way to spur new arms-control negotiations with the Russians . 
 ''I think it's important for us, commensurate with our ability to keep the peace, to reduce our nuclear arsenal on our own,'' Mr. Bush said after meeting at the White House with a bipartisan group of governors on his education proposals released this week. ''And I'm going to fulfill that campaign promise. That may, you know -- we'll see how that affects the possible arms talks.'' 
 Mr. Bush made his remarks, in response to a question, a day after receiving a letter from Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, outlining major issues facing both countries and calling for greater cooperation. 
 Mr. Bush said he had not responded to Mr. Putin's letter, though he planned to, joking that he had read about the letter, presumably in the media, ''before it hit Washington.'' He made it clear, however, that he did not intend to back away from his commitment to build a missile defense, even though it is one of the most contentious issues between the United States and Russia today. 
 ''My point is, is that I want America to lead the nation -- lead the world -- toward a more safe world when it comes to nuclear weaponry,'' he added, emphasizing his intent to build a missile shield and reduce nuclear warheads. ''On the offensive side we can do so, and we can do so on the defensive side, as well.'' 
 While he has moved aggressively on issues of abortion, education and taxes, Mr. Bush and his national security advisers have moved more cautiously in matters of foreign affairs. 
 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell swept into the State Department with a flourish, greeting the diplomatic corps at two pep rallies this week but outlining few details of how he intends to sell the administration's policies, including missile defense, which is strongly opposed by Russia and China. 
 Across the Potomac, Donald H. Rumsfeld began his second tenure as secretary of defense, wrestling with the Pentagon's budget and reining in the armed services' lobbying for more money. 
 Neither General Powell nor Mr. Rumsfeld have appointed their senior aides -- a point Mr. Rumsfeld noted when he made his first public appearances as President Bush's defense secretary today. Only today did Mr. Bush hold formal ceremonies at the White House to swear in General Powell and Mr. Rumsfeld, his two most important foreign policy advisers along with Vice President Dick Cheney and his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice. 
 As of last year, the United States had 7,519 nuclear warheads on missiles, submarines or bombers, while Russia had 6,464. Under the second strategic arms control treaty, or Start II, both countries are supposed to reduce their arsenals to roughly 3,000 to 3,500 warheads. 
 Russia's Parliament ratified Start 2 last year, though with conditions that many Republicans in Congress say they oppose. The two countries have also agreed in principal to a third round of negotiations aimed at reducing the numbers to 2,000 to 2,500 warheads. 
 Asked today when the administration would begin negotiations with Mr. Putin, General Powell replied simply, ''In due time.'' 
 Mr. Bush, as he did during the campaign, indicated that he was prepared, after a Pentagon review, to move ahead with reductions in the American arsenal unilaterally. Though he did not spell out his rationale today, he suggested in the campaign that such steps would clear the way for a new era in arms control and, possibly, Russian acceptance of an American missile defense. 
 At the Pentagon today, Mr. Rumsfeld restated his argument that the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, negotiated with the Soviet Union in 1972, was no longer relevant at a time when more countries were developing missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads and striking the United States. 
 ''We're in a very different world,'' said Mr. Rumsfeld, who served as secretary of defense under President Gerald R. Ford. ''The Soviet Union is gone. The principal threats facing the United States are not the fear of a strategic nuclear exchange with the Soviet Union.'' 
 Although he did not explicitly advocate withdrawing from the treaty, he added that he believed ''it ought not inhibit a country, a president, an administration, a nation from fashioning offensive and defensive capabilities that will provide for our security in a notably different national security environment.'' 
 Mr. Rumsfeld declined to say how quickly the Pentagon would move ahead with development of a missile system, including whether to begin construction of a sophisticated new radar on Shemya Island, Alaska, this summer, a step certain to antagonize the Russians, the Chinese and even some allies. He did say it was among the issues he would focus on in meetings next week. 
 A senior adviser to Mr. Rumsfeld said today that lifting the constraints imposed by the A.B.M. treaty would allow the Pentagon to develop a limited ground-based system, like than the one being considered under President Bill Clinton, more quickly. The adviser also said officials could more quickly expand the defense to include sea-based missile interceptors. 
 The adviser said ''the contours of something'' could be ready within 60 days."
"346","Debating Maazel's Musical Identity: Is It American or European?",1267190,"|new york|region",31,1,2001,"20010131T000000",NA," 
 The appointment of Lorin Maazel as the next music director of the New York Philharmonic has been interpreted with all the variations of a Rorschach test by musicians, composers, musicologists and others pondering the future of the American symphony orchestra in the 21st century. 
 Mr. Maazel, 70, who has conducted orchestras in Berlin, Vienna, Cleveland and Pittsburgh and who is now music director of the Symphony Orchestra of the Bavarian State Radio, will replace Kurt Masur, 73, in the 2002-03 season. His four-year contract will commit him to 10 weeks of subscription concerts in the first season and 14 weeks for the remaining three seasons. 
 To those who want to see American orchestras loosen their 19th-century European moorings, Mr. Maazel, an American who has spent much of his career on the other side of the Atlantic, is something of a throwback: an elderly conductor with extraordinary technical prowess, steeped in a venerable tradition but with no known passion for contemporary innovation. 
 Others insist that Mr. Maazel is as American as he can be: that is, the product of a blend of traditions and cultures, whose commitment to excellence will do one of the country's premier orchestras proud. 
 ''I couldn't be happier that it is an American conductor,'' said the composer Ned Rorem. ''It is about time. France has French conductors; Germany has German conductors. We are the only ones with the inferiority complex that thinks that Europeans are better.'' 
 Mr. Maazel is the first American to lead the New York Philharmonic since Leonard Bernstein stepped down in 1969 and only its third American conductor since the orchestra was established in 1842. 
 But Kim Kowalke, a professor at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester and president of the Kurt Weill Foundation for Music, said he saw Mr. Maazel as more of a European. 
 ''He doesn't come up on my screen as an American since he has spent so much of his career in Europe,'' he said. 
 Mr. Kowalke, an outspoken advocate for the advancement of a younger generation of American conductors and composers, said that Mr. Maazel's appointment -- coupled with the recent wooing of foreign conductors by other top American orchestras -- could be read like a sign on the door: ''Young American conductors need not apply.'' 
 But others argue that nationality has no place in the cosmopolitan world of music. 
 ''Who is an American, anyway?'' asked Leon Botstein, president of  Bard College and conductor of the American Symphony Orchestra, himself a naturalized American born in Switzerland. ''Do you have to wear a cowboy hat? Are you American if you are trained in America? What if you are an American trained in Paris? Who are you?'' 
 The notion that Americans are better conductors of American music is no more valid than the idea that only Russians can convey the essence of Tchaikovsky, Mr. Botstein said. 
 Joseph W. Polisi, president of the Juilliard School, said that Mr. Maazel's American roots -- he was born outside of Paris to American parents, but grew up in Los Angeles -- would serve him well in New York. 
 ''Knowing American traditions will be extraordinarily important in terms of community outreach and in terms of repertoire,'' Mr. Polisi said. ''He will have the sensitivity of someone who has grown up in the American environment.'' 
 Mr. Maazel's technical virtuosity gets high praise everywhere. ''He is the most accomplished conductor from the technical point of view,'' Mr. Botstein said. ''He has no peer.'' 
 But Mr. Maazel's job as music director will be not only to conduct the Philharmonic but also to provide it with a fresh artistic vision at a critical moment in its history. 
 ''I think the orchestra needs to figure out what it wants to be, and that is more crucial than choosing a music director,'' said Joseph Horowitz, an American historian of classical music, a consultant to several orchestras and the former director of the Brooklyn Philharmonic. 
 ''One hates to prejudge a situation like this, but the fear it provokes is that this signifies more business as usual than the Philharmonic can artistically afford,'' he said. 
 Even fans of Mr. Maazel's conducting wonder how and where he will lead the orchestra artistically. 
 ''Does a music director at the age of 70 have the ability to innovate?'' Mr. Botstein asked. ''The question is whether Maazel has the interest and the vision to radically rethink the relationship of the orchestra and the community, which was Bernstein's great talent.'' 
 But Mr. Botstein also recalled that, far from being embraced by the New York music establishment in his day, Bernstein ''was mocked, he was held in contempt, he was the show guy, the pop composer,'' he said. 
 ''It is a vicious misrepresentation of history to say that he was embraced by the city and the orchestra,'' Mr. Botstein added. 
 Whether Mr. Maazel will turn toward a more contemporary repertory is still unknown. Mr. Rorem remembered that 10 years ago, Mr. Maazel, a composer himself, conducted the Cleveland Symphony in ''Sun,'' a composition by Mr. Rorem for voice and orchestra. 
 ''I am interested in him insofar as he is interested in me, or rather me and the other men and women who are writing music, '' Mr. Rorem said. ''We will be lying in wait to see how much contemporary music he will play.'' 
 Correction:  February 7, 2001, Wednesday  An article last Wednesday about reactions to the appointment of Lorin Maazel as the next music director of the New York Philharmonic misstated the name of the first American orchestra he directed. It is the Cleveland Orchestra, not the Cleveland Symphony. 
 The article also misstated the time elapsed since Mr. Maazel conducted that orchestra in Ned Rorem's ''Sun,'' a work for voice and orchestra. It was in 1979, not 10 years ago. 
 The article also referred incompletely to Mr. Maazel's childhood residences. He was born in Paris to American parents and grew up not only in Los Angeles but also in Pittsburgh."

 Re ''Wrong Way on Energy'' (editorial, Jan. 31): 
 Why is there interest in the small area of the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge? Because there are potentially billions of barrels of oil there. 
 We are preparing a comprehensive energy program that includes renewables, alternative fuels, conservation and development. The goal is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. The parallel is that even one power plant could have made the difference in California's energy crisis, just as 16 billion barrels of oil could make the difference in our national energy security.

"348","Stake Sale Averts Collapse Of German Media Company",1271122,"|business",16,2,2001,"20010216T000000","|Germany"," 
 EM.TV and Merchandising A.G., the German media company that bought the Muppets and half the Formula One racing organization, escaped collapse today. But the prospects are much less clear for its chairman and founder, Thomas Haffa. 
 After two months of tangled negotiations and an unexpected battle with European car companies over the future of Formula One, EM.TV said today that it had agreed to sell a big stake in itself and the Formula One business to the Kirch Group, the Munich-based media conglomerate, for $550 million. 
 The deal gives EM.TV at least a measure of breathing room after coming perilously close to collapsing under a mountain of debt. Before it veered into a financial crisis last fall, EM.TV had appeared to be one of Europe's most spectacular entrepreneurial success stories. But it lost control after buying up rights to a huge library of children's programming, capped by the purchase of the Jim Henson Company last year, as well as its Formula One deal. 
 In the last few months, Mr. Haffa has been forced to restate the company's earnings, drastically reduce his forecasts and admit that he secretly sold shares of the company in violation of rules governing an EM.TV public stock offering. Mr. Haffa's brother, who was a co-founder of EM.TV, was forced to resign as chief financial officer last fall. Both brothers are being investigated by Bavarian authorities on suspicions of insider trading, and they face many lawsuits from angry shareholders. 
 Under the new agreement, Kirch will pay $550 million for half of EM.TV's stake in the Formula One business as well as 16 percent of EM.TV and voting rights equal to 25 percent of the stock -- enough under the German law to have a veto over major corporate decisions. 
 EM.TV, which currently owns half of a company that controls Formula One, will exercise an option to buy another 25 percent stake for $987 million from its current owner, Bernie Ecclestone. 
 Kirch and EM.TV announced the plan back in December, but the talks became bogged down in disputes over Formula One. DaimlerChrysler, BMW and Renault, which all sponsor Formula One race cars, were upset about losing influence over the racing organization and some had hoped for a chance to buy into it themselves. 
 Within EM.TV, executives also disagreed about the wisdom of selling to Kirch. EM.TV's chairman, Nicklaus Becker, is said to have wanted to sell the Formula One stake to Hellman & Friedman, an American investment firm. 
 But EM.TV and Kirch suggested that they would try to work out an additional deal with car makers in the months ahead. 
 In a statement released Wednesday night, the companies said they were ''interested in finding a long-term solution with both Bernie Ecclestone and interested car makers that will satisfy all parties involved.'' 
 Many industry analysts expect Mr. Becker to resign from the board, having been overruled by Mr. Haffa. But Mr. Haffa's own future is also in doubt, because EM.TV's binge of dubious accounting occurred on his watch. Earlier this month, Mr. Haffa admitted that he had violated German regulations and the terms of a recent stock offering by selling about $40 million worth of shares during the postoffering lockup period. 
 Investors, though initially euphoric that EM.TV had finally reached a deal with Kirch, grew more skeptical as the day progressed. EM.TV shares soared 35 percent initially, but then fell back and closed up only 5 percent, at 7.6 euros ($7)."

"350","Lucent Again Cuts Offering Price for Agere Spinoff",1279980,"|technology|business",23,3,2001,"20010323T000000","|Murray Hill|Allentown"," 
 Trying to entice investors in a sour market for initial public offerings, Lucent Technologies again cut the offering price of its Agere Systems  Inc. division yesterday, this time by 40 percent. 
 Lucent, the market-leading but struggling maker of telephone equipment, will sell 600 million Agere shares for $6 to $7 apiece, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. At the highest price, Agere (pronounced a-GEAR) would raise $4.2 billion, sharply down from its expectations last month for a $7 billion offering. 
 The price cut was Lucent's third. Last month, Lucent, based in Murray Hill, N.J., lowered the range twice -- first, to $16 to $19, and second to $12 to $14. The original offering price was $15 to $20. As the price has dropped, the number of shares issued has risen, from 370.3 million to 500 million to 600 million. 
 With 1.64 billion shares outstanding by the time the offering is completed, Agere, Lucent's microelectronics and optical components unit, based in Allentown, Pa., could have a market capitalization of as much as $11.48 billion. Lucent will hold 63.3 percent of Agere's stock, according to the S.E.C. filing. 
 The stock offering is imperative for Lucent's debt rating. Last month, the company avoided a possible downgrading of its debt to junk status by securing $4.5 billion in new credit lines. Lucent persuaded banks to promise $2 billion to extend a one-year line. Agere plans to assume the remaining $2.5 billion in debt by September, when Lucent expects the spinoff to be completed. 
 Moody's Investor Service rates Lucent's debt one notch above junk status. Bob Konefal, a managing director for Moody's, said the Agere offering was a ''critical liquidity event,'' a chance for Lucent to take some pressure off its troubled balance sheet. He said Lucent must carefully weigh its debt-rating needs with Agere's cash needs. 
 ''It's probably not a do-it-at-all-costs I.P.O.,'' Mr. Konefal said, ''but there's a lot of pressure on both companies to capitalize themselves in a way that ensures decent balance sheets for both.'' 
 The new offering also changes the way Lucent will repay its debt to its lead underwriter, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which had bought $2.3 billion in Lucent commercial paper. The two companies canceled a previous arrangement, in which Morgan Stanley would trade Lucent's debt for 200 million shares in the public offering. Now, Morgan Stanley has an option to buy as many as 90 million Agere shares if the offering is oversubscribed. 
 Lucent will probably repay Morgan Stanley out of cash on hand or from loan proceeds. 
 The debt reaches maturity next Thursday. 
 ''As the debt matures, they will be repaid,'' Michelle Davidson, a Lucent spokeswoman, said of Morgan Stanley, which declined to comment. 
 Other underwriters in the Agere offering include Bear, Stearns; J. P. Morgan; Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup; Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown; ABN Amro; Rothschild L.L.C.; SG Cowen; and Blaylock & Partners.

 Every other Thursday after work, rather than go home to her family in Plano, Tex., Dannellia Gladden-Green drives to the Omni hotel in Richardson, seven miles away, and cracks the books for her M.B.A. course the next day. 
 Much of the discussion in the classroom, she knows, will focus on the activities of a single company, Texas Instruments, which happens to be her employer. That is because Texas Instruments worked with the University of Texas to create a special M.B.A. curriculum for its up-and-coming managers. 
 Ms. Gladden-Green, 34, a trained engineer with a Ph.D. in electronic materials, says the classes are giving her a keener understanding of basic business principles. She hopes her degree, which she expects to earn in December, will enable her to move from her present position as a marketing manager to a more senior position. 
 ''I come from a technical background and there were a couple of things I wanted to get from the program, such as strategic thinking and business acumen,'' she said. ''Ultimately, I want to drive the strategic direction of an emerging business.'' 
 Texas Instruments is an early player in a fledgling trend: the customized M.B.A. While only a handful of such programs appear to exist (and they were not unheard-of in years past), corporate education experts predict they will become more common. ''We're seeing a huge uptick in interest in these programs,'' said Jeanne Meister, executive director of the New York-based Corporate University Exchange, a research firm. 
 Aside from its educational value, the customized M.B.A. offers corporations another carrot for luring and retaining talent -- a priority these days as baby boomers retire and corporations face a looming management shortage. 
 ''To become the employer of choice, we have to be very aggressive in offering educational opportunities to our employees,'' said Jay Wetzel, who retired this month as vice president and general manager of General Motors Technical Centers in Warren, Mich. G.M.'s North America engineering division plans a new joint technical degree program beginning next January that will include a G.M.-customized M.B.A. from Indiana University. 
 Rather than simply reimbursing their employees' tuition costs for a standard executive M.B.A., companies are finding that collaborating with a business school to create a program tailored to their industry and markets is well worth the extra cost. 
 No one expects the practice to sweep the country; only major corporations with big work forces can afford it, and even their programs are likely to be limited in size and duration. ''I don't think you're going to see hundreds, but 25 or so of these programs will spring up'' over the next few years, said Philip Zerrillo, graduate dean of the University of Texas at Austin business school. 
 Companies typically send managers to weekend classes at a nearby university, as Texas Instruments does. A few, though, sponsor Internet courses. Honeywell International in Morristown, N.J., started a pilot Internet program for 15 students in September 1999 with Capella University, an online school in Minneapolis. 
 The Intel Corporation in Santa Clara, Calif., is taking a mixed approach. Starting in May, it will fly business professors from Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., once a month to five Intel locations in Western states to teach courses to more than 30 employees. Other course work will be handled over the Internet. The tuition for each employee for the 27-month program is $52,500. 
 ''Babson is going to gear the homework towards the needs of Intel,'' said Alan Fisher, the company's manager for extended education programs. ''Instead of having homework, they'll have real work to do. It's not only an opportunity to learn, but an opportunity to problem-solve for Intel.'' 
 Texas Instruments, which is based in Dallas, began thinking about establishing its own M.B.A. program four years ago. The company knew it had great engineers, but also that it was going to need a lot of people with business knowledge to lead it in the future, said James M. Szot, who oversees the effort for his company. 
 Members of the first class began their studies in January 1999, and 49 graduated last December. The second slate of students numbers about half that. 
 First-year courses in the basics of accounting and finance are fairly general, but second-year electives chosen by Texas Instruments are more closely tailored to its own activities. That enables students to become de facto consultants to their own company, with a professor as adviser. ''Each team is assigned to work with a sponsor in Texas Instruments to examine a real business issue and come up with some recommendations,'' Mr. Szot said. ''Those can be pretty powerful.'' 
 Ross Teggatz, 37, a design engineering manager who graduated with the first M.B.A. class, says the courses changed how he does his job. ''In the past, I would design a part and if it didn't sell I'd blame the marketing people,'' he said. ''Now I understand that I have to design the part to help it sell.'' 
 Another benefit of such exclusive programs is that they allow executives at the sponsoring company to influence the curriculum and even become involved in it. Take Deere & Company, a maker of farm and other machinery in Moline, Ill. 
 Last fall, Deere collaborated with Arizona State University to begin a customized M.B.A. program that combined the traditional classroom with the Internet. When the students studied economics, in addition to hearing from the professor, they were able to click on a video of Robert W. Lane, the chairman and chief executive, and hear his economic views and his thoughts about Deere's markets. 
 The benefits of such a program to employees are fairly obvious: they get to work toward a degree without giving up their jobs to advance their careers. 
 To make sure the programs do not become too insular, some companies open them to employees from noncompeting concerns. From the start, Intel's will include five such people. ''We have a concern for our proprietary information but also a concern not to inbreed the culture,'' Mr. Fisher said. 
 A more prosaic reason for inviting outsiders is to fill slots. Texas Instruments opened this year's class, its third, to an employee of Cadence Design Systems Inc. in San Jose, Calif. Eventually people from other high-technology companies will be included, Mr. Szot said. ''Texas Instruments is not going to have enough candidates to support it.''

"352","Pesticide Notification Struck Down by Judge",1287522,"|new york|region",22,4,2001,"20010422T000000","|Nassau County (NY)"," 
 A judge has struck down a pesticide notification law in Nassau County after finding that the county failed to perform a required environmental impact study. 
 The ruling, by Justice Stephen A. Bucaria of State Supreme Court in Mineola, nullified a unanimous vote by the county Legislature last year to enforce the law beginning March 1 of this year. 
 The state law, designed to take effect only in counties that elect to participate, requires that commercial pesticide applicators give neighbors 48 hours' advanced notice before spraying residential properties. 
 The decision, on April 11, was a setback for breast cancer groups and environmental organizations that lobbied for eight years to gain passage of the state law. 
 John Zaher, a spokesman for the county executive's office, said no decision had been made on an appeal. 
 ''The costs will be passed on to consumers, and some will apply pesticides themselves rather than pay the higher costs,'' Frederick Eisenbud, the lawyer for a tree-spraying company that brought the suit, said about pesticide notification. He noted the law also exempted governments, agriculture, golf courses and property owners. 
 Backers of the law said it allowed people to take precautions, like bringing children, pets and outdoor furniture inside, before spraying occurred next door.

 Thomas L. Friedman (column, May 22) provides an excellent analysis of the bloodshed between Israel and the Palestinians. I contest only  his statement that the inability of American Jewish leaders to speak out against settlement expansion ''is a blot'' on them, among others. Not all of them. 
 Here is the official statement of the Labor Zionist Alliance, released earlier this month: ''We oppose the further establishment or expansion of settlements in the territories. This policy has proved to be a major obstacle to peace. It does not have the support of the majority of the Israeli population, and has provided constant ammunition for Palestinian rejectionists.'' 
 It is unfortunate that our voices and those of our allies in the Zionist peace camp are often drowned out by the din of the irredentists, Jewish and Palestinian.

 The sky is still there. Harriet and Leonard Walit and Khay Cochran are not. 
 On the evening of July 11, 2000, Mr. and Mrs. Walit came home and smelled gas in their town house at 420 State Street. They called their neighbor, Mr. Cochran, to help them investigate. One of the three flipped on a light switch, which apparently was the act that ignited an estimated 4,000 cubic feet of gas in a thunderous explosion. 
 Today, grass has begun to grow where the town houses at 418 and 420 State Street once stood. A few fingers of ivy have curled their way up through the chain link fence that fronts on the empty lots. In the back is the ghost of a garden. A red Japanese maple, one birch tree and a  stone cherub remain. Neighbors say hyacinths bloomed in the spring. 
 Last weekend, the Institute for Community Living added a more permanent piece to the jigsaw of memories on State Street. The organization unveiled a bronze commemorative plaque at 415-417 State Street, a 32-bed treatment residence run by the institute. The facility, which serves people with histories of homelessness, mental illness and substance abuse, was christened the Walit House in memory of the Walits and Mr. Cochran. Mrs. Walit, a retired social worker and neighborhood activist, was on the institute's board at the time of her death. 
 ''She gave people a sense that they had control and that they could be significant in terms of being in control of their own lives and in terms of helping people,'' said Peter Campanelli, the institute's president. ''I think that was her legacy.'' 
 Friends and neighbors eulogized the three for their active roles in the tight-knit block between Nevins and Bond Streets. ''They had to look for what is wrong,'' said Julian Jackson, Mr. Cochran's companion of over 53 years. ''This time it was a very serious mistake.'' 
 Mr. Jackson and a friend who was visiting, Francis Aguirre, were rescued from 418 State Street on the night of the explosion. 
 ''I looked and saw the back wall disintegrating,'' Mr. Jackson recalled. He called to Mr. Aguirre, ''Please look upstairs and tell me what you see.'' Mr. Aguirre's response is etched in Mr. Jackson's memory: ''I see the sky.'' That is how Mr. Jackson knew the house was gone. 
 ''I hadn't thought about life without Khay,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''We'd been together too long. But tomorrow isn't guaranteed to anyone.''

 To the Editor: 
 A July 11 front-page article about the massacre of the Jews of Jedwabne by their Polish neighbors on July 10, 1941, focuses on the attitude of many Poles who still seek to deny their complicity in this horrific act. 
 Why is it that the perpetrators of this crime have gone unpunished? Why has it taken more than 50 years for Polish authorities to begin an investigation into what took place? 
 Full acceptance into the Western family of nations should be denied to any Baltic or former Eastern European-bloc country that does not demonstrate a complete repudiation of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by its countrymen in World War II. This would require bringing criminal charges against all those involved in, for example, the massacres at Jebwabne, at Babi Yar in Ukraine, Kovno in Lithuania and Riga in Latvia.

"359","Jeffrey Archer, Guilty of Perjury, Is Jailed for Four Years",1310744,"|world",20,7,2001,"20010720T000000","|Great Britain|Britain"," 
 Jeffrey Archer, the millionaire author and member of the House of Lords with a roguish past of surviving repeated brushes with scandal, was convicted on perjury charges today and jailed for four years. 
 Lord Archer, 61, saw his vaunted escape artist reputation fade when a jury at the Old Bailey returned unanimous verdicts of guilty on two counts of perjury and two of perverting the course of justice. 
 ''These charges represent as serious an offense of perjury as I have had experience of and have been able to find in the books,'' Justice Humphrey Potts told the court as he ordered the peer to begin serving time immediately. He also directed him to pay $250,000 in costs or face an added year in jail. ''This has been an extremely distasteful case, I can tell you,'' he added. 
 Lord Archer was found guilty of creating false diaries and concocting a bogus story to win a 1987 trial over whether he had slept with a prostitute to whom he paid $3,500 in hush money. He claimed at the time that he had never met her, and the case ended up in court because he sued the newspaper carrying the report, The Daily Star, and obtained an $800,000 libel judgment. 
 The Star said today it would seek $3 million from Lord Archer in a civil action based on today's finding that he had based his case against the paper on lies and forgeries. ''No one should have any sympathy for Jeffrey Archer,'' said the editor, Peter Hill. ''He is a proven liar, a cheat and a chancer, a man so arrogant that he thought he was above the law. Now he has gotten what he deserves.'' 
 Lord Archer-super-Mare, as he is known formally, has been the subject of fiercely denied accusations over the years ranging from serial philandering to insider trading to shoplifting suits in Canada to fabricating war hero credentials for his father and academic achievements and degrees for himself. He has had to resign from politics in disgrace on three occasions -- in 1974 as a member of Parliament, in 1986 as deputy chairman of the Conservative Party and in 1999 as Tory candidate for mayor of London when the current case arose. 
 He reacted to that fall from grace in the kind of risky and brash fashion that has made him one of Britain's longest-running tabloid personalities. He wrote a courtroom play called ''The Accused'' and cast himself in the role of the defendant. In a striking piece of timing, he appeared for the first night in his stage role on the same day that he had to appear at a police station to be formally arrested for perjury. 
 Until today, he had always bounced back, writing his best-seller books and even persuading John Major, the Conservative prime minister, to make him a life peer in 1992 despite the fact that he had continually brought shame on the party. 
 Justice Potts told Lord Archer today that he could not overlook the fact that after committing a crime,  ''you have gone from strength to strength, you resumed your political career and, at some point, were ennobled to become a member of the House of Lords.'' 
 His comeback-kid skill owed much to his personal charm and to the hospitality he showed people in positions to help him recover his status. He has divided his life between a 17th-century vicarage in Cambridgeshire and a Thames-side penthouse with panoramic windows overlooking Parliament and Big Ben that is filled with modern sculpture and French Impressionist paintings. There he stages parties featuring Krug Champagne and shepherd's pie that have become cherished gathering spots for the political elite. 
 He has enjoyed the steadfast public loyalty of his wife, Mary, 56, a Cambridge-educated biochemistry professor of steely English beauty and immaculate tailoring who is the mother of the couple's two sons, William, 29, and James, 27. The three attended court today as they had throughout the weeks of trial. 
 The case has seldom been off the front pages and succeeded today in banishing news of President Bush's two-day visit to Britain to the inside of the evening papers. The court had heard titillating testimony from past secretaries about Lord Archer's many affairs and about false entries he asked them to put into substitute diaries that he subsequently submitted to the trial court in 1987 to give him alibis for the night he was accused of having slept with the prostitute. He swore in court that the bogus diaries were the originals. 
 The secretaries also revealed that a young assistant named Andrina Colquhoun was actually Lord Archer's live-in mistress during the period when Lady Archer was giving critical testimony in the earlier trial that she and her husband had a full and faithful marriage. 
 Lady Archer's 1987 testimony has entered judicial annals here because of the rapturous effect it had on the judge, Sir Bernard Caulfield, in his jury instruction. 
 ''Your vision of her will never disappear,'' he said then. ''Has she elegance? Has she fragrance? Would she have, without the strain of this trial, radiance?'' And of Lord Archer, he said, ''Is he in need of cold, unloving, rubber-insulated sex in a seedy hotel?'' The comments were considered a key element in his court victory then. 
 Lady Archer testified again in this trial but was unable to rescue her husband this time. Lord Archer himself, one of Britain's best-known communicators, did not take the stand. 
 Lady Archer lost her composure only when asked about her husband's liaison with Ms. Colquhoun. She had heard about it from a newspaper, not from him, she said. ''Wives are not always the first to find out about these things,'' she said. Had it carried on longer than she had thought?  ''You have heard more than I have,'' she replied, adding, ''I think we explored the further reaches of 'for better or for worse' more than some other couples.'' 
 Lady Archer and her sons were driven away from the court this afternoon in the family's chauffeured grey BMW that had brought them there each day with Lord Archer. He was locked into an individual cell in a prison van that carried two other prisoners, one a drug dealer convicted of stabbing a man to death and the other a man accused of child molesting. 
 One of Lord Archer's lawyers, Tony Morton-Hooper, said the peer would appeal."
"360","Recipe for a Refuge in Louisiana: Wetlands, Wading Birds, Oil Wells",1311703,"|science|health",24,7,2001,"20010724T000000",NA," 
 Louisiana is rich in both wealth-producing and awe-inspiring natural resources, but nearly a fifth of its residents are poor, and politics and pollution often threaten its wild treasures. 
 But in the heart of Cajun country, a wilderness preservation group and an oil company are trying to strike a balance between conservation and commerce. That is the goal of the Cypress Island Preserve, one of the nation's largest and most important wading-bird rookeries and the site of a handful of oil and gas wells, three miles from Breaux Bridge on the western edge of the Atchafalaya Basin in southwestern Louisiana. 
 The rookery took root in ancient wetlands that exist today mostly because Texaco held on to the parcel for nearly a century. Much of the land has been deeded to the Nature Conservancy of Louisiana, with the latest donation in March. 
 The bird colony, which roosts in the preserve's Lake Martin, is being closely watched. Since wading birds are at the top of the food chain, said Dr. Bruce Fleury, a visiting instructor in ecology and evolutionary biology at Tulane University, the birds ''are the canary in the coal mine for the wetland habitat.'' 
 The viability of the rookery and its hardwood ecosystem will depend on how well the birds and other wildlife fare with oil and gas wells for neighbors, with the commotion of growing numbers of tourists, with stagnating water and with the anger of neighboring farmers who say the birds look at their crawfish ponds as all-you-can-eat buffets. 
 The habitat of Cypress Island -- not a natural island, but named for its stand of cypress -- has mostly thrived. Starting in the 1970's, bird populations there boomed with the rise in nearby crawfish farming, Dr. Fleury said. The rookery appears to have held an average of 15,000 birds since 1996, said Dr. Thomas Michot, a wildlife biologist with the National Wetlands Research Center, part of the federal Interior Department. Researchers suspect that the number may have dropped recently and will begin a new count in August. 
 In many quarters, the idea of oil and gas drilling in ecologically sensitive areas like the Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a hot political issue. 
 ''There's no such thing as risk-free oil and gas development,'' said Jim Waltman, director of the national wildlife refuge program for the Wilderness Society in Washington. 
 But residents of the Lake Martin area seem to take the drilling in stride. A recent report on preserving the area, prepared for homeowners and politicians, did not even mention the nearby oil and gas operations. 
 Preserving Cypress Island is crucial to stemming the decline of the Lower Mississippi Valley ecosystem, said Dr. Keith Ouchley, executive director of the state's Nature Conservancy. Cypress Island is ''one of the last remaining large blocks of hardwood forest'' in an area from southern Illinois to the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, Dr. Ouchley said. 
 Lake Martin was formed more than 6,000 years ago in a Mississippi River flood. It was a slough until 1953, when the state encircled 765 acres with a levee, creating 200 acres of open water, now used as a recreational area. The birds nest primarily in 250 acres at the southern end of the lake that Texaco donated to the Nature Conservancy. 
 On a recent visit, 10,000 to 20,000 or so little blue herons, great blue herons, cattle egrets, snowy egrets, tricolored herons, black-crowned night herons and yellow-crowned night herons filled spindly buttonbush branches, just yards from the preserve's heavily traveled road. They were joined by 100 or so pairs of gaudily pink roseate spoonbills. Great egrets nested above the fray in stout tupelo cypress boughs. 
 The lake area supports other wildlife, including 1,800 to 2,000 alligators that float at the edges of the roosts, ready to snap up wayward hatchlings. Migratory songbirds nest in the spring and refuel in the fall in the dense woods, Dr. Ouchley said. Two hundred species have been identified, including warblers, vireos, flycatchers, gnatcatchers, grosbeaks and buntings. 
 The Louisiana Nature Conservancy began its stewardship in 1994, when Texaco gave it 2,600 acres, including Lake Martin. With the oil and gas deposits running low, Texaco donated 6,000 acres more, mostly south of the lake, in March. Once the paperwork is complete, the conservancy will have 8,600 acres, plus a few hundred it bought on its own. 
 ''We wanted to show that you can balance competing needs in an environmentally sensitive area,'' said Beth Picou Claude, a Texaco spokeswoman in New Orleans. The company kept the mineral rights, which it leases to EnerVest Management Partners, which is based in Houston. It has also given the conservancy  $500,000 for community education. 
 The Louisiana conservancy has no legal authority over oil production on its preserve, said Cindy Brown, the  chapter's Cypress Island project director. But she said EnerVest had been cooperative when asked to avoid certain areas. EnerVest's chief operating officer, Mark Hauser, said, ''We really do respect the beauty of the environment.'' 
 EnerVest's area for oil and gas production is in the preserve but across a highway and three miles from Lake Martin and its rookery. Eight wells each occupy a 2,000-square-foot clearing, and short pipelines lead to storage tanks, where oil and gas are trucked out. The three active wells pump a total of 1,500 barrels per day, said Dean Broussard, EnerVest's production manager. 
 Mr. Hauser said that any new wells would be drilled directionally, slanting through existing wellheads. 
 The birds' other neighbors, the crawfish farmers, cannot help being annoyed when they see thousands of birds gorging on crawfish when the  artificial ponds are drawn down after the spring harvest, said Dr. Jay Huner, director of the Crawfish Research Center at the University of Louisiana in Lafayette. The state occasionally gives farmers permits to  kill nuisance birds, but farmers say it is hard to make an impact. 
 Jeff Durand, manager of 1,800 acres of crawfish at Durand Ponds, 10 miles from the lake, said noisemaker shells and pyrotechnics had not scared off the waders. 
 From the birds' point of view, the 17,000 acres of crawfish ponds  around Lake Martin provide a smorgasbord of small fish, snails, aquatic insects, frogs and crawfish. The only formal study of the birds' effect on the crawfish ponds was done in 1985 by Richard Martin, who is now director of conservation programs for the state Nature Conservancy. 
 Mr. Martin estimated that wading birds consumed 5 to 10 percent of a farm's production. But he also found that birds thinned out the ponds. That process, he contends, allows a more profitable harvest of larger crawfish. He added that his study was ''crying out for replication.'' 
 Dr. Huner agreed. Even if remaining crawfish grow larger, he said, farmers may still lose money. 
 In the absence of firm data, Dr. Huner has been trying to convince farmers that they can thwart waders by digging deeper ponds and choking the ponds with vegetation. ''The answer is not killing things,'' he said, ''but managing around them.'' 
 Crawfish are essential for the birds, and the birds are crucial to plans to maintain Lake Martin as a tourist attraction. Much of the area used to be a trash dump. Now, about 90,000 vehicles per year cruise the  levee's Rookery Road. But there is concern that there may be a Yellowstone in the making. 
 ''Some swamp tour operators were boldly chain-sawing their way into the nesting areas,'' said Theresa Privat, who owns property on the lake and is president of the Lake Martin Advisory Council. A state rule adopted last spring prohibits people from entering the nesting area from February to July. 
 Meanwhile, the lake is slowly dying; it has no natural drainage and receives tons of bird droppings a  year. So the conservancy will start draining Lake Martin into surrounding wetlands this fall and will bring in fresh water from a canal. 
 Though the birds seem comfortable with their less than pristine neighborhood, the idea is to keep their habitat as quiet as possible. ''Nobody knows what these birds are thinking,'' Mr. Martin said, ''so we try to err on the side of conservation and limit disturbance.'' 
 That means restraining encroachment, whether from overeager tourists or oil company workers. 
 So far, Dr. Fleury said, ''even though it's fragile, everything at this point is looking good.''"
"361","Cut by Kansas City, Martin Will Aid Jets' Run Defense",1322383,"|sports",4,9,2001,"20010904T000000",NA," 
 The Jets signed defensive tackle Steve Martin today. He was among Kansas City's final cuts last weekend, and the Jets hope he can help plug the considerable hole in their run defense created by the loss of Jason Ferguson. 
 Martin (6 feet 4 inches, 319 pounds) will have three days of practice to get ready for Sunday's season opener against the Indianapolis Colts, although James Reed, a rookie, had been told over the weekend that he would start the game. The Jets gave Martin, 27, a one-year deal that is worth a little more than $600,000 including incentives. At the same time, they put Ferguson on injured reserve, which officially ends his season. 
 ''You have to be able to walk in the door and play,'' Martin said. ''I did it in Philadelphia three years ago. Over the years, you get used to that kind of stuff. I think it's something I can adapt to quickly. It's a pretty basic defense, very similar to defenses I've run in the past.'' 
 Martin, who is in his sixth season, was a reserve last year for the Chiefs, where Terry Bradway was vice president of player personnel before he joined the Jets as general manager. Martin had 27 tackles and 17 quarterback pressures. He started 15 games in 1999 for Philadelphia and had 60 tackles, 2 sacks, 6 quarterback pressures and 2 forced fumbles. His release from Kansas City was something of a surprise -- he had started each of their preseason games -- and he recently bought a home there because he plans to settle down in Missouri, where he went to college, when he retires. Bradway said he received calls from Chiefs Coach Dick Vermeil and from the team's president, Carl Peterson, endorsing Martin. 
 ''It was definitely a shock to me,'' Martin said of being cut by Kansas City. ''I didn't see it coming. They told me the younger guys may not be ready early on, but over the course of time will be better suited to what they're trying to do with the defense there.'' 
 The Jets made the decision on Martin fast. For meetings this morning, they brought in Tim Morabito, who was recently waived by the Carolina Panthers, Ernie Logan, the former Jets nose tackle, and Martin. The Jets did not meet with Russell Maryland, 32, who was released Sunday by Green Bay, and Bradway said Maryland's age and recent back trouble were factors. 
 The Jets' choice really came down to Martin and Morabito, because both had played during the preseason and were in football shape. Logan was not in any team's training camp and would not have been ready to play immediately. By 3 p.m., the Jets had their new nose tackle, and Martin was planning to spend the evening in defensive meetings and preparing to face Indianapolis, the team with which he began his career. An hour after signing Martin, the Jets waived Maurice Anderson, who was second on the depth chart to Reed and who had started two preseason games. That could clear the way for the Jets to bring in another nose tackle, a possibility Bradway held open today. 
 ''He's a good addition to our team,'' Coach Herman Edwards said of Martin. ''He's familiar in that he has played in this conference before. We figure that he'll help in the development of James Reed. He is strong at the point of attack. He's a durable player, with starting experience.'' 
 Bradway said Martin could play the nose or the three-technique tackle position that Shaun Ellis occupies. Martin said his best quality is being able to take on the double team, something with which Reed has struggled. ''They needed some more experience inside,'' Martin said. ''The young guy certainly has the ability to do the job. He just doesn't have the experience. I'm ready to go for 16 games.'' 
 Before Martin signed, Reed said he was trying not to be bothered by talk that a veteran could soon supplant him. 
 ''It's not a distraction to me,'' Reed said. ''When I get in there, I'll make the best of the opportunity.'' 
 EXTRA POINTS 
 Punter TOM TUPA said Monday that his hip flexor felt good, and that he would try to punt Wednesday, for the first time since before the Giants game 10 days ago. Tupa, who did not punt in any preseason game because of lingering soreness in his hip flexor, said he should definitely be ready to go for the second game of the season, in Oakland, but will not punt Sunday. Tupa said he punted so much trying to break the scar tissue from his off-season hernia surgery that he strained his hip flexor. ''It's frustrating,'' Tupa said. ''The whole goal was to get over the surgery, and then this pops up.''. . . General Manager TERRY BRADWAY said that because the Jets have other needs, they will not bring offensive lineman JUMBO ELLIOTT back right now. . . . Linebacker JASON GLENN, a rookie who is cornerback AARON GLENN's younger brother, was claimed off waivers by the Jets. He was released Sunday by Detroit. Aaron is 5-9, 185 pounds. Jason is 6 feet, 231 pounds. . . . The Jets put tight end DANIEL WILCOX, quarterback TORY WOODBURY, center/guard TUPE PIKO, running back MARLION JACKSON  and defensive tackle GIRADIE MERCER to their practice squad.

"363","Left Bank Fulfills Lofty Expectations",1327684,"|sports",23,9,2001,"20010923T000000",NA," 
 It was February 1999 in north Miami and the trainer Todd Pletcher remembers the moment vividly: Demi O'Byrne handed Pletcher a sales slip showing they had just purchased a son of French Deputy for $600,000. 
 ''All I expect is a Grade I victory,'' said O'Byrne, who manages the racing stable for Michael Tabor. 
 It took two years, but in the Vosburgh Stakes at Belmont yesterday, Left Bank finally brought home that Grade I victory. He blew past Squirtle Squirt in the final yards of the seven-furlong sprint to post a half-length victory in 1:20.73, the second-fastest running in the race's 62 years. He paid $9.50 for a $2 bet to win and earned $180,000 for Tabor. 
 ''He was in the bridle the whole way; it was pretty easy,'' said John Velazquez, Left Bank's jockey. 
 Even though it was his 10th victory in 18 starts, Left Bank had struggled against top sprinters. He finished a desultory eighth in the Metropolitan Mile in May and a lazy fifth in last year's Cigar Mile, and he was nettled by heavy traffic in the Forego at Saratoga. 
 In the Forego, at least, Left Bank ran a close second and demonstrated he could unleash a finishing kick. It was a new dimension to the usually front-running colt. It was little wonder that Pletcher waited until the 11th hour to enter Left Bank to take on a field of six -- including the odds-on favorite, Squirtle Squirt -- after drawing an outside post. 
 ''He was training good and acting right; we were thinking about the Breeders' Cup Sprint and needed points to make the field,'' said Pletcher, referring to the $1 million Sprint that will be run at Belmont on Oct. 27. 
 Tactically, we thought we were in a good spot on the outside. The main thing we were trying to do was not use our horse too much and not let Squirtle Squirt get away. It wasn't the fact that Squirtle Squirt was stopping. It was that Left Bank really finished well today. 
 Left Bank cruised behind an eager Squirtle Squirt, who ticked off rapid fractions of 22 3/5 for a quarter mile and 44 2/5 for a half. 
 ''I wanted to wait to make my move,'' Velazquez said. 
 The gamble worked, according to Jerry Bailey, Squirtle Squirt's jockey, because his 3-year-old colt was going longer against older horses. 
 ''He ran hard,'' Bailey said. ''Going seven-eighths against older horses was a lot to ask of him. I'm glad the Breeders' Cup Sprint is six furlongs.'' 
 It was the second straight stakes victory on the afternoon for Pletcher, who won the off-the-turf Noble Damsel a race earlier with Tugger. 
 Earlier, Velazquez guided Express Tour to an upset victory in the $150,000 Jerome Handicap. Express Tour, trained by Saeed bin Suroor, paid $18.

 Here are glimpses of some of the victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center. 
 DAVID G. CARLONE  Catching Up With Friends 
 David G. Carlone was a man who knew his own mind and followed his own road. On their first date 25 years ago, said his wife, Beverly, he told her that he was going to marry her. And he later vowed that he would run a marathon in under three hours. He accomplished both goals. 
 Mr. Carlone, 46, had given up the grind of commuting daily from Randolph, N.J., into New York City. He had worked at the World Trade Center for many years, but about six years ago, as his three sons -- now ages 12, 15 and 17 -- hit the age of sports teams and after-school games, he quit and took a job as an account executive at an insurance company 15 minutes from home. 
 But he still had many friends in the towers. When he would go in for an occasional business meeting, as he did the morning of Sept. 11 at Aon's offices on the 105th floor of 2 World Trade Center, he would actually look forward to it, Ms. Carlone said. It was an opportunity to catch with the places and people that had once been his world and that were still very dear to him. 
 EDWARD LICHTSCHEIN  The Favorite Uncle 
 Edward Lichtschein had master's degrees in physics and engineering, designed software for eSpeed, and prided himself on solving challenging computer glitches that stumped others. He was also a favorite uncle to nine nieces and nephews, ages 8 to 33. 
 ''He was 35, but in certain ways he was a kid at heart,'' said Vera Glatt, his sister. 
 With his older nieces and nephews, Mr. Lichtschein, of Park Slope, Brooklyn, swapped videos and CD's, and critiqued movies, ''The Simpsons'' and rock music. With the younger ones, he took nature walks in a wildlife preserve behind his brother Mark's home in Teaneck, N.J. Everybody always received cartoon sketches from him parodying family members and family life. 
 Two cousins, Yoni Glatt, 19, and Avi Lichtschein, 15, have been particularly despondent over his death, Ms. Glatt said. ''They were angry at us for accepting it.'' 
 RICHARD A. ARONOW  Always in the Know 
 Richard A. Aronow was always so eager to share the fact that his lunch buddies at the Port Authority, where he worked for more than 18 years, called him sensei, Japanese for teacher. ''Whatever they knew, or thought they knew, he knew more,'' his wife, Laura Weinberg, recalled. 
 Among the things Mr. Aronow, 48, of Mahwah, N.J., knew a lot about was markets, whether it was the stock market or the intricacies of frequent-flier plans, and he was forever switching long-distance companies to find the best deal. 
 As a deputy chief of the agency's law department, Mr. Aronow worked on some huge legal deals -- most recently, the lease for the new $1.4 billion International Arrivals Terminal at Kennedy Airport -- and he knew the details of all the Port Authority's leases, documents so voluminous that they are called telephone books. 
 Mr. Aronow was considered a fair adversary; about 20 lawyers who had been on the opposing side of his deals attended his memorial service last month, his wife said. 
 JONATHAN CONNORS  A 'Tip Top' Life 
 His license plate was ''Tip Top,'' which was also one of his nicknames and his reflexive response to ''How ya doing?'' His other nickname -- having at least one is practically a prerequisite on Wall Street -- was ''J.C.,'' short for Jonathan Connors, a 55-year-old senior vice president of Cantor Fitzgerald who loved to make money, wear Armani, dance the Lindy, dine at Nobu and, whenever possible, be surrounded by strong, independent, beautiful women. 
 His wife, Susan Connors, said he greeted her not with a peck but with a full-blown kiss. He liked to hold her hand tightly. When she was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, the two dug in together to fight off the effects. ''Whatever he did,'' she said, ''it turned to gold, never silver.'' 
 Soon after the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, Mr. Connors constructed a diorama of his brush with terrorism. In a red-framed box, he displayed mementos of that day -- the soot-covered shirt and tie he wore, the cashmere scarf he used as a mask, his train ticket, the next day's front page. He mounted the box on a wall in his house. It was, his wife said, an act of catharsis, remembrance and defiance all at once. 
 Mrs. Connors recently took it down. ''I couldn't stand to look at it,'' she said. 
 JACQUELINE YOUNG  Avoiding Noise, not Music 
 Jacqueline Young, known as Jakki, hated noise. She hated it so much that she moved to Staten Island, even though she had no relatives there, for some quiet. Raised in South Carolina, Ms. Young, 37, who worked for Marsh & McLennan, the consulting firm, often talked about moving out of the city altogether and searched for jobs in other states. 
 ''She wanted to be where life was at a slower pace, where it was not so hectic all the time,'' said her mother, LaBertha McKenly-Williams. 
 Ms. Young's brother, James McKenly, accompanied her to a job interview in Virginia last year, and when the hotel they were staying in proved too noisy, she insisted they move to another one. 
 It was about 20 miles away, he said. 
 Despite her need for quiet, Ms. Young, who was unmarried, often took her nieces and nephews on excursions and loved to dance. 
 In July, she danced at the wedding of another brother in Brooklyn. ''She was so happy for him,'' Mr. McKenly said. 
 DAVID P. DERUBBIO  'Dave Was an Experience' 
 If you knew David P. DeRubbio -- ''Crazy Dave'' or ''Crazy Uncle Dave'' to his family -- you knew about the jokes and you knew about the milk. 
 The fifth of seven children, Mr. DeRubbio, a Brooklyn firefighter, was famous in the family for his countless ways of getting around the household rule against profanity and for the zany nicknames he gave out. 
 ''Dave was an experience,'' said Angela Tiberi, his younger sister, who contended with being nicknamed, ''Witchie Poo.'' 
 He doted on his daughter Jessica, 12. He nicknamed her ''Pestica.'' 
 To avoid using one profanity at home, Mr.DeRubbio would say, ''What the H-E- double hockey sticks is going on?'' Callers who encountered him at the other end of the line would typically find themselves being serenaded. 
 Mr. DeRubbio, 38, was such a milk hound that their mother joked about buying a family cow just to meet the demand, his sister said. 
 To the delight of his friends and family, none of this stopped after Mr. DeRubbio, who joined the Fire Department in 1998 and was assigned to Engine Company 226, became an adult. 
 ''I know he's up there,'' Ms. Tiberi said. ''And he's got everyone rolling.'' 
 GERTRUDE ALAGERO  The Luckiest in the World 
 She always had time for a friendly chat with the corner newsdealer and the counterman at the deli, and she was sometimes forgetful about paying parking tickets and bills. But Gertrude Alagero, nicknamed Trudi, was also a determined competitor. After she taught her fianc, Peter B. Walther, to snowboard, she never let him beat her when they raced down Okemo Mountain in Vermont. 
 Ms. Alagero, a senior vice president at Marsh Private Client Services, a division of Marsh & McLennan, and Mr. Walther, who was her supervisor before they began dating in 1998, had planned to marry in Boston on Jan. 5. 
 A few days before the terrorist attack, Mr. Walther said, she pressed her fingers to his mouth while they were walking toward the subway from their Upper West Side apartment. 
 ''Shhh,'' she said, ''I need to tell you something: I am the luckiest woman in the world.'' 
 On Sept. 7, the day that Ms. Alagero turned 37, she gave Mr. Walther a Nikon camera so he could become adept at using it before their honeymoon in Africa. He snapped two rolls of pictures, mostly of her. 
 EDWARD C. MURPHY  Defying Easy Categorization 
 Edward C. Murphy's life brimmed with contrasts and deep loyalties. He was a staunch Republican who invested in real estate and race horses. But he also helped nonprofit groups raise money for food and clothing for poor children in his native Clifton, N.J. 
 He loved the vitality of Manhattan but insisted on living in Clifton, where he headed a town board that improved traffic safety, especially around schools. Mr. Murphy, 42, was a managing director at Cantor Fitzgerald and was as busy as the job title implies, but every morning at 9 sharp, he called his mother Evelyn, a 77-year-old widow. On Sept. 11, her phone rang on schedule, minutes after the first jetliner hit. 
 ''He said, 'Mom, I'm O.K., I'm getting out,' '' said Mr. Murphy's brother Daniel. ''She just cherishes that moment.'' 
 Mr. Murphy's girlfriend of 17 years, Maryann Flego, called him a ''quick-witted maverick '' who jogged for years and loved both classical and rock music and the works of Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock and R.C. Gorman, a Navajo artist in the Southwest. He delighted in haggling to cut prices of many of his purchases, whether a pearl ring for Ms. Flego or a pretzel at a ball game. 
 LISA L. TREROTOLA  Surviving Ills, One at a Time 
 After Lisa L. Trerotola's appointment with the oncologist, she went to her mother's house and burst into tears. Lisa was not a complainer, and her mother feared the worst, that the thyroid cancer was terminal. 
 ''No, no!'' Lisa said. She was sobbing because her treatment required isolation, which meant, ''I'm going to have to leave my babies for two whole weeks!'' 
 Mrs. Trerotola's family was rocked by her cancer, but she went through treatment keeping her eyes on the prize: her twins, now three and a half years old, whom she had struggled for years to conceive with her husband, Michael. Life kept road-testing Mrs. Trerotola, 36, of Hazlet, N.J. 
 In addition to cancer and infertility, she had prevailed over other health problems, including a chronic bronchial condition that she believed was triggered by fumes from the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, where she worked as an administrative assistant at the Port Authority. 
 ''You know the sweetest thing my sister did?'' said her brother, Paul Spina. ''She was planning a surprise party Oct. 6 for my brother-in-law's 40th birthday. Sent the invitations and everything. He has no idea. Would you put that in the newspaper? I don't have the heart to tell him.'' 
 THOMAS DAMASKINOS  Passionate Fan of Broncos 
 Thomas Damaskinos, his wife is quick to point out, was a passionate Denver Broncos fan long before John Elway came along. No, Mr. Damaskinos' Broncos fixation started 23 years ago, when he was 10. His brother gave him a Broncos cap, and that was that. So what if the Broncos lost every game he ever attended? 
 Last year, for her husband's 32nd birthday, Jennifer Damaskinos found the perfect gift for him -- the official N.F.L. John Elway Retirement Helmet, autographed and embossed with Mr. Elway's career statistics. And when Mile High Stadium was put out of commission, he simply had to have a souvenir. 
 ''He bought two of the seats because he never got to go,'' Mrs. Damaskinos said. ''They are supposed to come next month.'' 
 Mr. Damaskinos, vice president for operations at Cantor Fitzgerald, had other obsessions. He taped every single episode of ''The Simpson's,'' for example, and on some nights, he and his wife indulged in Simpson marathons, calling out favorite bits of Simpson dialogue. 
 And then there were his children, Jessica, 13, by his first wife, and Matthew, 1. Jessica and her father had a nightly ritual. He would tuck her in and then they would race to see who could say ''I love you'' the fastest and the most. 
 STEPHEN J. CANGIALOSI  The Great Shirt War 
 Stephen J. Cangialosi will be remembered for ''The Shirt.'' Yes, he was a devoted father and husband, loyal friend, successful bond trader at Cantor Fitzgerald and a die-heart Yankees fan. But it was ''The Shirt.'' 
 For years, he made fun of his Georgetown University classmate, Andy Stearns, for wearing a stained, plaid, late-1970's shirt with wide lapels throughout college. To get him back, Mr. Stearns wrapped it, threw a bow on the box and gave it to him as a gift. Not to be outdone, Mr. Cangialosi wrapped it in a big box with a bow and gave it back. That went on for about 17 years. It would turn up on holidays, birthdays and anniversaries. 
 ''It's so ugly,'' Mr. Stearns said of the shirt, laughing. 
 Mr. Cangialosi, 40, of Middletown, N.J., will also be remembered for a horror movie, ''Ghost Story,'' that another Georgetown classmate produced. Mr. Cangialosi, an athletic 6-foot-1, was the star. Simply put, it was 28 minutes of horrible. But, oh, how they loved to watch it and laugh together, Mr. Stearns said. 
 While memorializing his friend, Mr. Stearns suddenly remembered that Mr. Cangialosi had given him ''The Shirt'' for his 40th birthday. He decided that it would be fitting to give it as a gift to Mr. Cangialosi's wife, Karen. 
 DONALD ADAMS  Gaining Entry to Happiness 
 In the summer of '92 he was a bouncer, 6 feet 5 inches tall, at some long-gone beach bar on the Jersey Shore. She was cute and underage, hoping to sweet-talk her way through the door. ''He was nice and let me in,'' Heda Adams said of the day she met her husband, Donald Adams. 
 Turned out that both were students at Fairleigh Dickinson University. He was a fraternity boy, No. 77 on the offensive line. ''Yes, I was pinned,'' Mrs. Adams said, laughing. 
 Six months ago they had their first child, Rebecca, who, it is already clear, shares her father's outgoing, extroverted personality. 
 On summer evenings, Mrs. Adams and Rebecca would sit on the porch of their home in Chatham, N.J., waiting for Mr. Adams, a 28-year-old vice president at Cantor Fitzgerald, to walk up the road from the train station. ''There's my girls,'' he would call out. 
 After dinner they would sometimes take a stroll through the neighborhood, sharing their day in the intimate short-hand of couples who are both lovers and best friends. 
 ''I was H. He was D. Just the first letters. That's all we needed.'' 
 JON GRABOWSKI  Love, Philosophy and Plato 
 It was a love story that began at a bagel shop in Maryland, over a conversation about Plato. Jon Grabowski, a student at the University of Maryland, managed to make sense of philosophy for the woman he later married, Erika Lutzner, a classmate and coworker at the bagel store, when her professors could not. 
 He was enigmatic, devilish, selfless ''too smart for his own good,'' -- as she wrote in his eulogy -- and he could always make sense of the world, of himself, of her, she said. His friends and colleagues said that too, in interviews and memorial e-mails filled with recollections of his wry wit, helpfulness and deep love for his wife, a chef. 
 Mr. Grabowski, 33, was vice president for technology information at Marsh & McLennan, a job in the World Trade Center that he had begun only a week before the Sept. 11 terrorist attack. 
 Mr. Grabowski and Ms. Lutzner were together for 12 years. He won her over during their second week of dating, when he brought her Tylenol and orange juice after she came down with the flu. 
 ''I felt like we were one soul,'' she said. ''Plato wrote about searching for your other half. Jon was my other half.'' 
 JAMES LADLEY  Pleasure in the Mundane 
 Simple things made James Ladley happy. Things like little activities with the kids. He would take Elizabeth, 4, and James, 2, to pick up the mail. Or to get the newspaper. Or just run around the yard. 
 He was a soft target. He would be watching baseball, and his son would yell from his bed, ''Daddy, get me out of the crib. I want to watch the Yankees.'' Mr. Ladley would fetch James and plop him down beside him, where James would watch a few pitches and promptly fall asleep. 
 ''It didn't take much to make Jimmy happy,'' said his wife, Sheri. 
 Mr. Ladley, 41, a bond broker at Cantor Fitzgerald, would not miss dinner with the family. ''We always waited for him,'' Sheri said. ''He got home at 7, and we always ate together and then he would help give the children a bath and he and I would read them stories. It was a group effort.'' 
 He had succeeded enough at work that he was contemplating retiring within three years. ''He wanted to take the kids to school,'' Sheri said. ''He wanted to coach their sports. He wanted to spend more time with me. He wanted to downsize his load.'' 
 Dinner at the Ladley home has not been the same. The meal never started until he was there. Every night, Elizabeth and James ask for Daddy. 
 WILLIAM ABRAHAMSON  The Linchpin of His Friends 
 In his 58 years, William Abrahamson generated enduring circles of friends. There was the Public School 8 schoolyard group, from his childhood in Brooklyn Heights. There were his colleagues from the Federal Reserve Bank, who met in the late 1960's and remained closest friends ever since. 
 As the men scattered to different states, it was Mr. Abrahamson, a business analyst at Marsh & McLennan, who kept the group together. 
 ''He was the quieter guy, very secure about who he was,'' said Ann Abrahamson, his wife of 25 years. 
 In a group of strong personalities, she said, ''he was the mediator, always above the squabbles.'' 
 When their son, Erik, was born 11 years ago, Mr. Abrahamson, like many older fathers, looked upon the boy as a gift and a mission. 
 ''Erik was his pride and joy,'' Mrs. Abrahamson said. ''All he wanted was to see him grow up.''

 Her book, a stinging indictment of drug-tainted political corruption in Colombia, was a sensation this year in France, where she became known as Madame Colombia.

 With the book, ''The Rage in My Heart,'' now being released in Colombia, intensive coverage might be expected here, too.

Youthful and charismatic, she is a former congresswoman and senator who won widespread support here for denouncing corrupt colleagues and the graft-ridden administration of a former president, Ernesto Samper, whose election campaign was accused of taking money from drug traffickers. That Ms. Betancourt's book is to be released in the United States by HarperCollins on Jan. 7 might be expected to generate further interest. 
 But last week, as Ms. Betancourt embarked on a publicity campaign, the news media was strangely silent. No reviews in the leading newspaper, El Tiempo. No television cameras at her door. 
 For Ms. Betancourt, 39, daughter of a former Unesco ambassador to Paris and a Colombian congresswoman, the indifference is emblematic of a country where corruption is the norm -- but few are willing to make denunciations. 
 ''Corruption is not abstract; it has a face, and it has a name and we have to say it,'' said Ms. Betancourt, who wears well-tailored business suits and appears a decade younger than her age. ''Corruption must be consciously confronted, and has to be on the conscience of all Colombians so that we cannot be manipulated.'' 
 To her detractors, such talk is self-serving drivel aimed at garnering votes and selling books, at both of which she has succeeded quite well. 
 ''I do not recognize her moral authority to judge any Colombian,'' said Senator Marta Catalina Daniels. ''This is the easy way to become popular, attacking people and carrying out this moral terrorism.'' 
 Indeed, though many Colombian blame institutional corruption for the country's unending civil unrest, Ms. Betancourt's style of in-your-face accusations does not sit well here. 
 ''We are a society that likes to ignore,'' said Santiago Vásquez, a political scientist. ''So many people do not like that style, and so they treat her like she is crazy.'' 
 But her unorthodox methods of calling attention to corruption have also made her a household name. In her successful run for congress in 1994, she passed out condoms on street corners -- symbolic protection against rampant corruption -- and in 1998 she drew a record number of votes to win a senate seat. 
 As a congresswoman she went on a hunger strike to call for an independent inquiry against former President Samper. (Congress cleared him of the charges anyway.) 
 Such tactics have not left her without enemies. Her persistence led to death threats against her and her family, forcing her in 1996 to send her children to live outside of Colombia with their father. 
 ''The people who are in power do not care for me one bit,'' said Ms. Betancourt, who travels with as many as a dozen bodyguards at all times. ''There are a lot of people who have an interest that people not know what is really happening in Colombia.'' 
 Ms. Betancourt said she tried at first to get her book published in Colombia, but was rejected by publishers. 
 A French publisher became interested after hearing about Ms. Betancourt's travails. She was asked to write her story in French for XO Editions, which she did while living here. A legal challenge by former President Samper failed to stop publication, but succeeded in generating intense news coverage in France, where the book was released in March. Ms. Betancourt was feted by the press and the literary world. 
 It helped that she had lived in France years ago before returning in 1990, speaks flawless French, and was educated at the exclusive Liceo Francés in Bogotá and later the Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris. Her two children, Mélanie, 16, and Lorenzo, 13, are products of her first marriage, to a French diplomat. 
 But the French were entranced by her book -- a biography tracing her comfortable upbringing and then her transformation into a corruption fighter who faced numerous death threats. It spent 13 weeks as a best seller and was No. 1 for four of those weeks, selling 120,000 copies. 
 HarperCollins is now hoping that the book -- to be published in English under the title, ''Until Death Do Us Part: My Struggle to Reclaim Colombia'' -- will find similar success in the United States. 
 In Colombia, however, there was clear discomfort with a Colombian airing the country's dirty laundry abroad. Semana, Colombia's leading newsmagazine, portrayed Ms. Betancourt as Joan of Arc, saying that in her book ''practically all'' Colombians ''are bad, except for her.'' 
 But that was eight months ago.  One magazine here, Cambio, ran a small item this week noting that her ''proselytizing activities'' received  more coverage in the foreign press. 
 The indifference, though, did not seem to bother dozens of book buyers who swarmed around Ms. Betancourt last week as she went from one book signing to another. Many buyers, shaking her hand or kissing her cheek, expressed disgust with the country's politicians. 
 ''I'm tired of being deceived,'' said one buyer, J. Orlando Rodríguez, as he greeted Ms. Betancourt. ''I like your ideas. Do not deceive me.'' 
 Ms. Betancourt, holding his hands, smiled and said, ''I would never deceive you.''"

"369","Amgen Seen Near Deal to Buy Immunex for About $16 Billion",1352260,"|u.s.",17,12,2001,"20011217T000000",NA," 
 Amgen Inc. was nearing a deal last night to acquire Immunex for about $16 billion in stock and cash in a transaction that would help Amgen become the first biotechnology company to gain the stature of a major pharmaceutical company. 
 The merger would unite two of the oldest companies in biotechnology and some of the industry's most lucrative products. Amgen will gain rights to Immunex's rheumatoid arthritis drug, Enbrel, which is expected to have sales of more than $1 billion next year and which Immunex projects could eventually reach sales of $4 billion a year. 
 The deal was being considered yesterday by the boards of both companies, as well as that of American Home Products, which owns 41 percent of Immunex, people close to the deal said. Details and contracts were still being worked on late yesterday. The companies are hoping to announce the deal today. 
 People close to the deal said that it would be valued at about $16 billion, with about 15 percent in cash and the rest in stock. Amgen would pay about $30 a share for Immunex. But Amgen's shares have fallen 13 percent since rumors of the merger first surfaced on Thursday, and it was not clear late yesterday whether the terms of the deal had changed. 
 The transaction would be the largest merger by far in the biotechnology industry, which has experienced a spate of acquisitions as companies struggle to expand their product offerings. The acquisition would also be a departure for Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., which until now has grown largely through internal development. 
 Despite being the nation's largest biotechnology company, Amgen until recently had only two big products -- Epogen, which is used to treat anemia, and Neupogen, which prevents infections in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. While each has sales of more than $1 billion a year, they have been on the market for 10 years or more and their sales growth is flagging. 
 Kevin W. Sharer, a former nuclear submarine officer and telecommunications industry executive who took over as Amgen's chief executive in May 2000, is trying to expand the company's product offerings. He has promised investors that sales and earnings per share would grow 20 percent or more a year until 2005. Amgen's revenue should reach $8 billion to $9 billion by then, more than double the current level, he has said. 
 Mr. Sharer has said he would be interested in acquisitions, particularly one that is large enough to make a difference but not so large that Amgen would not be able to digest it. People close to the company said it has been thinking for months that Immunex fit this bill. 
 But by acquiring a drug, Amgen might be acknowledging the difficulties it has had developing drugs of its own. Until this year, the company has not introduced a significant new drug in a decade. And the big new drug it introduced this year, Aranesp, is really just a new version of Epogen that requires fewer injections. Next year, Amgen hopes to win approval for a new version of Neupogen. Kineret, a drug for rheumatoid arthritis introduced this year, is Amgen's first really new drug, and analysts expect it to have only modest sales. 
 The deal, reports of which first surfaced on Thursday, has been criticized by some analysts and Amgen shareholders who said that Amgen might be paying too much and would hurt its earnings. Such concern caused Amgen's stock to drop 13 percent since the close of trading Wednesday. It closed Friday at $56.03. But people close to the deal said Amgen thought that the acquisition would add to earnings per share starting in 2004. 
 Some shareholders and analysts also said the acquisition would distract the company when it appears to be on the cusp of a new wave of growth spurred by the new versions of Epogen and Neupogen. 
 ''Now it's a time for them to focus on executing to get those products to the market,'' said Linda Miller, portfolio manager of the John Hancock Health Sciences and Biotechnology funds, both of which own Amgen shares. ''Shareholders have been patiently waiting for the payoff,'' she said. ''To take your eye off the ball and buy something sizable at that juncture is a little confusing to me.'' 
 American Home Products would become an owner of about 8 percent of Amgen's stock. The company, based in Madison, N.J., will get some cash that could be used to help pay for the billions of dollars it has agreed to pay out in settlements of litigation over its diet pills, used in the fen-phen combination. It is expected that American Home Products will retain the rights it has to sell Enbrel and share in the revenue from that drug."

 Many Americans are surprised at the speed with which assurances that immense federal surpluses were here to stay gave way to the reality of deficits. Some of us, however, aren't surprised; we're simply following a trail blazed in places like Richmond and Austin. In the 1990's most states had Republican governors; and they applied the same strategy -- using what-me-worry forecasts and bogus accounting to justify tax cuts for the affluent -- that the Bush administration applied at a national level in 2001. In both cases the consequences were predictable. 
 The difference is that state governments are generally prohibited by their constitutions from borrowing to cover deficits. Eventually the federal government, too, must live within its means -- but spin and denial can delay the reckoning. State chickens come home to roost a lot faster. In other words, the state of the states is the shape of national things to come. 
 How bad is the state fiscal crisis? The National Governors Association recently reported that its members faced a combined shortfall -- that is, a gap between projected revenue and projected spending -- of at least $40 billion, and quite possibly $50 billion. The latter number would be almost 10 percent of states' budgets, a very large number indeed. 
 If 10 percent doesn't sound that big to you, remember that much state spending, like much federal spending, cannot be cut -- especially on short notice. A budget shortfall of 6.5 percent in the early 1990's led to severe cuts in services and forced 44 states to raise taxes; this one looks considerably worse. 
 How did states get themselves in this fix? The biggest proximate cause of the budget crunch is the end of the great 1990's boom; second place goes to surging medical costs. Expenses for homeland security add a final insult. 
 But stuff happens; why didn't states prepare for a rainy day? Although they can't borrow in bad times, state governments can accumulate reserves in good times. Instead, however, many governors acted as if the boom would never end. 
 They increased spending -- though not all that much; spending by state and local governments was about the same share of G.D.P. at the end of the 1990's as it was at the beginning. 
 More important, they cut taxes. Now it's true that state governments raised taxes in the early 1990's -- but as new work by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows, they didn't cut the same taxes they had previously raised. Increases in regressive taxes -- that is, taxes like the sales tax, which bear most heavily on lower- and moderate-income families -- by and large were never reversed. Instead, states cut taxes that bear most heavily on upper-income families. The end result was a redistribution of the tax burden away from the haves toward the have-nots. A family earning, say, $30,000 per year pays considerably more in state taxes than a family with the same constant-dollar income did in 1990, while a family earning $600,000 per year pays considerably less. 
 The way for these selective tax cuts was cleared not just with forecasts that made no allowance for contingencies, but with creative accounting worthy of Enron. For example, in 1999 the governor of Texas -- yes, him -- justified new corporate tax breaks with a budget that not only understated Medicaid costs by $550 million but hid regular payments for nursing care and other services by moving them from the last month of fiscal 2001 to the first month of 2002. Just last year, with the fiscal picture already darkening, Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia (who resigned as head of the Republican National Committee after his party lost the Virginia and New Jersey state houses) evaded a ''trigger'' rule that was supposed to postpone tax cuts in the event of a revenue shortfall; he booked an estimate of the entire value of future payments from tobacco companies as current revenue. 
 Now the states must deal with the effects of past chicanery even as they face recession, soaring health care costs and the fiscal impact of terrorism. The result will be layoffs of teachers and policemen, medical care denied to the poor, delayed repairs to roads and bridges, and -- eventually, when it can no longer be avoided -- tax increases. And why do I think I know whose taxes will go up? 
 It's not a pretty picture, but you should get accustomed to it. As the states go, so goes America.

 In the summer of 1904, Hermann Merkel, the chief forester at the Bronx Zoo, noticed that a few of the majestic American chestnut trees lining the zoo's walkways had developed a mysterious new disease. The next year, nearly every chestnut tree in the parks of the Bronx had the disease. And by the 1950's it had spread from Maine to Georgia, killing billions of chestnut trees and changing the East's wooded landscapes forever. 
 Merkel had discovered the disaster known as chestnut blight, giving scientists their first bitter taste of the imported diseases that have been sweeping through American forests ever since. 
 The best known are chestnut blight and Dutch elm disease, both of which are believed to have come from Asia and are still attacking trees today. But scientists say a host of devastating forest pathogens have continued to arrive. Among the most recent is sudden oak death syndrome, which has killed thousands of oaks and other trees in California and may threaten the mighty redwood as well. 
 Fast-moving and usually hard or impossible to cure, these exotic diseases have destroyed countless trees in forests, cities and suburbs. The results can be seen not only in landscapes stripped of some of their most beautiful species but in changes to how forest ecosystems work and in the economic value of this natural resource. 
 ''I get concerned about what the forests of the future will look like,'' said Dr. Craig G. Lorimer, a forest ecologist at the University of Wisconsin. ''To have so many diseases cause so many problems over such a short period of time is really unprecedented. You get this impression that clear-cutting is the most devastating thing that's ever happened to North American forests, and it's not. This is much more serious.'' 
 As world trade intensifies, scientists predict that more and more tree diseases will find their way into the country (and out of it). And while most pathogens die on arrival, unable to find a suitable victim or climate, a small portion turn into devastating blights. According to a report last month from the National Academy of Sciences, about 13,000 plant diseases a year are intercepted by inspectors at international ports of entry -- and these inspectors are able to examine perhaps 2 percent of the incoming cargo and baggage. 
 The effect of such invasions is clear. A fungus called dogwood anthracnose has killed millions of flowering dogwoods in the southern Appalachians alone, essentially wiping out the species in many areas. In the Southeast, butternut canker has hit butternut trees so hard that the species has been listed as threatened in at least one state, Tennessee, and has been declared a species of special concern, a prelude to consideration for federal listing as threatened or endangered. 
 In the Northwest, an imported root disease is killing off Port Orford cedars, whose wood can be worth as much as $50,000 for a single, mature tree. And the list goes on. If imported insects are included among the pests, the casualty list grows even longer; some species are attacked by both kinds of imported pest. 
 Dr. Don Goheen, a plant pathologist with the United States Forest Service in Medford, Ore., who works with Port Orford cedars, echoed the comments of others, saying: ''These introduced diseases are bad news. We're run ragged by them.'' 
 Though the devastation goes on around the country, it has received little notice outside the community of forest researchers -- largely, scientists say, because a diseased tree can take years to die and its loss is not always evident to the casual observer. 
 ''When you look out there you don't have a barren moonscape,'' said Dr. Scott E. Schlarbaum, a forest geneticist at the University of Tennessee. ''You have a forest. But that forest is very different than it was 100 years ago.'' 
 The loss is most likely to be noticed when the tree is prized for its beauty. The rapid spread of dogwood anthracnose, a fungal disease that begins with spotting leaves and soon ends in the death of the tree, has robbed many communities of flowering dogwoods, long a joyful herald of spring. 
 Dr. Mark Windham, a plant pathologist at the University of Tennessee, says the disease is attacking Pacific dogwoods in the West and flowering dogwoods in the East, with the southern Appalachians hardest hit. 
 In 1989, Dr. Windham said, he saw 20,000 healthy trees on Lookout Mountain in Tennessee go under. ''They became fully blighted in two weeks,'' he said. ''In three years most were dead.'' 
 Researchers estimate that in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, 60 percent of the dogwoods have been killed by the disease. But even this well-traveled area may not look too bad to the casual visitor: roadside dogwoods do well, exposed to sunshine, which the fungus dislikes. ''Tourists don't tend to get out of their cars, so they might not see much,'' Dr. Windham said. ''Several hundred feet into the woods they'd see a different picture.'' 
 Likewise, dogwoods in sunny yards can escape unscathed. 
 Besides being beautiful, dogwoods play a number of roles in the forest. The leaves have high levels of calcium, making them a primary food for lactating deer. In addition, the calcium in decaying leaves keeps soils from becoming too acidic, a growing concern now that dogwoods have disappeared from so many areas. And the outer coat of the berries is 20 percent fat, making them a crucial source of energy, for example, for songbirds. 
 Likewise, animals are thought to have suffered when chestnuts disappeared. Before 1900, one out of every four trees in the East was an American chestnut, an abundant hardwood and a hearty nut producer. Dr. Frederick V. Hebard, staff pathologist at the American Chestnut Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the Herculean task of restoring the tree, says oaks and hickories typically produce hundreds of pounds of nuts per acre -- but when chestnut trees were also present, that same acre produced thousands of pounds of nuts. Chestnuts were said to have covered the ground like marbles. 
 The bounty was devoured by chipmunks, voles, bear, deer, turkey, grouse, crows and people. (The roasted chestnuts sold by street vendors generally come from Europe).) 
 In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, ''people moved here expressly to get land up on Clinch Mountain, where there were so many chestnuts you could set pigs out to forage in the fall,'' said Dr. Hebard, speaking from the foundation's field station in Virginia. ''Before there were ever cowboys in America, there were pigboys, herding up pigs on horseback and setting them loose to forage.'' 
 Rare trees are being hit hard, too. Butternut or white walnut trees, which produce a beautiful wood favored by carvers and cabinetmakers, have nearly been wiped out in the Southeast by butternut canker, a fungus whose country of origin is unknown. 
 Among the most worrisome pests from abroad are the various species of Phytophthora, a group of funguslike organisms that includes the culprit that caused the Irish potato famine in the 19th century. Another species of Phytophthora, whose origins remain mysterious, showed up in native forests in the 1950's, attacking the roots of Port Orford cedars. It continues to attack them today. 
 In addition to being a highly valuable commercial wood, these cedars are critical to Northwestern forests. Their fibrous root systems shore up river banks, and their durable wood, once fallen in a river, provides important fish habitat -- critical functions where many species of salmon are struggling. 
 Yet another species of Phytoph thora has been found to cause sudden oak death syndrome, which has jumped to 14 different plant species since it was first noticed in 1995. Last month, researchers at the University of California reported finding DNA evidence of the disease on dying redwood shoots. Scientists are continuing laboratory tests to see whether the new disease can indeed kill this beloved species, or whether something else is doing in the redwood shoots. 
 Sometimes these imported diseases can be treated, if caught early and if enough fungicide is applied or enough limbs are cut off. But such expensive cures are usually attempted only for individual trees on private property. Cures on a forestwide scale are, in general, impossible. Even curbing the spread of the diseases is difficult, as many travel as tiny wind-borne or water-borne spores or on insects flying from tree to tree. 
 Instead, researchers are seeking to identify and breed disease-resistant trees. In some cases, for example with chestnuts, researchers are creating hybrid trees that are a mixture of resistant foreign species and natives. In other cases, nature itself provides the answer. 
 In Catoctin Mountain Park in Maryland, where nearly all the dogwoods have died, researchers discovered one thriving dogwood whose branches were entwined with several others that had died. That tree has since given rise to a disease-hardy line known as Appalachian Spring, which has just become available for sale. 
 And scientists say one lesson that has come from these blights is the importance of diversity, particularly in planted landscapes. The graceful branches of the Dutch elm, for example, once arched over streets in nearly every city and town. Scientists say its very popularity may have led to the epidemic. 
 ''People came west with this vision that that's what a street should look like,'' said Dr. George Ware, a tree scientist at the Morton Arboretum in Lisle, Ill. They planted row upon row of the elegant vase-shaped tree, producing a monoculture ripe for an epidemic. 
 ''We really brought about the devastation,'' said Dr. Karel Jacobs, a tree pathologist at the Morton Arboretum. ''We loved them too much.'' 
 As a result, Dr. Jacobs said, researchers urge managers to plant more diversified landscapes to help slow or prevent the spread of diseases. Yet she added that most cities and towns remained worrisomely undiversified, with a handful of favored trees in abundance. 
 Still, hope lives on, even for chestnuts. Dr. Hebard says that in undisturbed forests there are billions of chestnut sprouts that have been growing since the original epidemic decades ago, still too small to be hit by the disease. One promising avenue of research is work on viruses that can attack the chestnut blight fungus attacking the tree. 
 But while many scientists aim for a return to the forests of old, some researchers say that goal is unrealistic. 
 ''The concept was always that disease is bad, but that paradigm has shifted,'' said Dr. John Castello, a forest pathologist at State University of New York's College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse. Disease can perform functions like killing weak trees and releasing nutrients for other plants. ''The question really is, how much disease is enough?'' he went on. ''That's what foresters and pathologists are trying to determine now.'' 
 People, he said, should move from the notion that the only good forest was the one that was here before Europeans arrived. ''The idea that everything will remain the same without change is just wrong,'' he said. ''Change is the rule.'' 
 Correction:  February 7, 2002, Thursday  Because of an editing error, an article in Science Times on Tuesday about tree diseases from abroad misstated the name of the species blighted by Dutch elm disease. It is the American elm; Dutch elm is the name of the disease, not the tree."
"374","TV Catch Phrase From the 1960's Is Evoked in a Hearing Over Enron",1366237,"|business|washington",9,2,2002,"20020209T000000","|Massachusetts (USA)"," 
 ''I know nothing.'' 
 That phrase, from a television sitcom that ended its original run when Richard M. Nixon was president, is resonating again decades later in the most recent sign of the durability of the detritus of popular culture. 
 The phrase was evoked on Thursday by Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, during the testimony of Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former chief executive of the Enron Corporation. The congressman's remark -- that Mr. Skilling was using ''the Sergeant Schultz defense of 'I see nothing, I hear nothing' '' -- was intended to express skepticism of Mr. Skilling's testimony that he was unaware of the problematic practices that led Enron to file for bankruptcy protection. 
 ''I know nothing'' -- also rendered as ''I see nothing, I hear nothing, I know nothing'' -- was uttered innumerable times during the six-year run on CBS of the sitcom ''Hogan's Heroes.'' The character who made the phrase part of the vernacular was Sgt. Hans Schultz, played by the actor John Banner. Schultz, along with Col. Wilhelm Klink, was among the German officers who oversaw Stalag 13, the World War II prisoner- of-war camp that was the setting for the series. 
 The phrase ''I know nothing'' has become shorthand for blind ignorance of obvious facts because it was used by Schultz to profess his supposed inability to uncover or stop the schemes to undermine the Nazi war effort by the Allied prisoners, led by Col. Robert Hogan. 
 That a catch phrase from a sitcom that ran from 1965 to 1971 is still heard is not so unusual in an America that looks to the popular culture to make points on weightier matters. 
 For instance, in a 1995 decision by the Indiana Supreme Court, Indiana Department of State Revenue v. Zinat Safayan, Ms. Safayan's case was summarized as ''a tax code version of the Sergeant Schultz defense,'' described in a footnote: ''The Sergeant Schultz defense refers, of course, to the refrain of the character by that name in the television comedy 'Hogan's Heroes.' '' 
 In the current campaign in Illinois to nominate candidates to run to succeed Gov. George Ryan, the incumbent whose term has been plagued by scandal, one Republican, State Senator Patrick O'Malley, has posted on his Web site an article that describes Mr. Ryan as the governor ''who was there but says, like Sergeant Schultz in 'Hogan's Heroes,' 'I know nothing.' '' 
 On ''Special Report With Brit Hume'' on the Fox News Channel in January 2001, Mr. Hume compared Hillary Rodham Clinton to Schultz in characterizing her denials of knowledge of her brother's role in a pardon granted by President Bill Clinton to a businessman. 
 Of course, speakers and journalists do not have to rely on dim memories of ''Hogan's Heroes'' on which to base their references. After leaving CBS, the series was rerun on local stations. The reruns resurfaced nationally with occasional appearances in the Nick at Nite programming block on the Nickelodeon cable network, owned by Viacom. 
 The reruns moved to a sibling channel, TV Land, in April 1996, and they still appear, twice daily at 8:30 a.m. and 11:30 p.m. Eastern time. The series is also featured on the TV Land Web site (www.tvland.com) and has been the subject of advertisements by the network to encourage viewership. 
 ''It's a great performer for us,'' Larry W. Jones, executive vice president and general manager for TV Land and Nick at Nite in New York, said yesterday, adding that it appealed to both ''people who are familiar with the show and people finding it for the first time.'' 
 ''As soon as someone says 'I know nothing,' you know exactly what he means,'' he added. ''It's something that's 30 years old and yet it never went away.'' 
 ''Hogan's Heroes'' was produced by CBS with the singer Bing Crosby and created by Bernard Fein and Albert S. Ruddy; Mr. Ruddy later produced films like ''The Godfather'' and ''The Longest Yard.'' 
 ''When I read it this morning, I fell out of my chair,'' Mr. Ruddy said yesterday in a telephone interview, referring to Representative Markey's remarks. ''It was very apropos, I must say.'' 
 ''Schultz always knew what was going on,'' Mr. Ruddy said. ''He would turn a blind eye. He just didn't want to get involved.'' 
 As for whether the Schultz defense could work for Enron executives, Mr. Ruddy said: ''You can get away with it in a television series. It's a little harder when it's real.''

 GRACEFULLY INSANE 
 The Rise and Fall of America's 
 Premier Mental Hospital. 
 By Alex Beam. 
 Illustrated. 273 pp. New York: 
 PublicAffairs. $26. 
 ''CLAYMOORE is a top-notch place,'' the psychiatrist tells a suicidal Winona Ryder at the start of the movie ''Girl, Interrupted,'' urging her to commit herself to a nearby asylum with a national reputation. ''A lot of people go there -- even writers. Like you!'' Now that depression has become a literary subgenre, with confessional memoirs of the self-consciously despondent topping the charts, it would be hard to think of a more persuasive marketing campaign for a mental hospital. Claymoore is in fact McLean, in Belmont, Mass., where Susanna Kaysen, author of the best-selling book on which the film is based, spent nearly two years in the late 60's. Other illustrious alumni (to name only the writers) include Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton, who, before being admitted herself, taught a Tuesday night poetry seminar in the hospital library. On the basis of literary achievement alone, McLean would seem to have a better track record than many institutions of higher learning. 
 McLean figures in the biographies of these and other famous patients, among them, the mathematician John Forbes Nash, winner of the Nobel in economic science; Ray Charles (following a drug bust); the Taylors -- James, Livingston and Kate; and several analysands notorious in psychiatric circles, to say nothing of Frederick Law Olmsted, who, having planned the hospital's new campus after its move from nearby Charlestown in 1895, lived out his last years there in a single-patient home, the victim of a series of brain hemorrhages. Now we have the biography of the place itself, its title taken from what Sexton admiringly said of Lowell: ''You are so gracefully insane.'' 
 A columnist for The Boston Globe, Alex Beam succeeds in telling several stories simultaneously, weaving an account of changing attitudes toward mental illness, the methods employed in its treatment and the shifting context of the larger culture into an entertaining narrative that centers on the hospital and its history. McLean was founded in the early 19th century, the product of an idea born in Europe -- that a bucolic setting might prove beneficial to the mentally ill. The only hospital of its kind in Boston at the time, McLean catered to patients from every level of society until 1833, when the Worcester State Asylum opened its doors and siphoned off those too poor to pay their own way. From then on, McLean specialized in the treatment of a clientele that Lowell called ''the thoroughbred mental cases.'' Indeed, the accommodations and services seem to have been modeled on those of a five-star hotel: fireplaces, private bathrooms and ample closet space; two tennis courts, two indoor gymnasiums and a nine-hole golf course, plus croquet, ice skating and cross-country skiing on the grounds; room service and restaurant-quality food; silver tea sets, antique furniture and Oriental rugs. On behalf of the patients, the nursing staff wrote thank-you notes, sent flowers and, with the arrival of warm weather each spring, arranged for the transfer of their furs into cold storage. Upham Memorial, a men's residence, was nicknamed ''the Harvard Club'' because at one time its four corner suites were all said to be occupied by Harvard graduates. 
 Over the years, as one seemingly arbitrary theory of mental illness gave way to another, so did its hypothetical cures, and Beam describes the harrowing array of treatments to which this hapless population was subjected -- not only electric shock but lobotomy, insulin coma and hypothermia, reducing the patient's body temperature to a near-death state. The indulgence inherent in the service was offset during the 50's by an approach called ''total push,'' which obliged residents to get out of their pajamas, get dressed and go for walks, as if a strong dose of Calvinist rigor could cure patients who traced their lineage to the Mayflower. 
 Beam remarks on Olmsted's layout, which ''relegated deeply disturbed patients to the periphery of the grounds, where their rantings resounded offstage.'' The same might be said for ''Gracefully Insane,'' which depicts McLean's patients as charmingly eccentric, harmful primarily to themselves. Even Louis Agassiz Shaw, a murderer and a snob who inhabited a book-lined suite in Upham Memorial, and Carl Liebman, a paranoid schizophrenic unsuccessfully analyzed by Freud, are cheerfully presented in the context of a cast straight out of a 30's screwball comedy. Shaw, who had strangled his maid, acquires a sidekick, ''a Bible-thumping companion'' by the name of Joan Tunney Wilkinson, daughter of the famous boxer Gene Tunney and sister of Senator John Tunney, accused of killing her husband on Easter Sunday, 1970. ''At McLean,'' Beam writes, she ''came under the sway of the Christian revival group the Way. . . . At hall meetings . . . Wilkinson was wont to say, 'Louis, we must confess our sins.' His inevitable answer: 'Oh, Joan, no.' '' Liebman, whose conviction that he was being followed by detectives was cited by his doctors as evidence of his incurable paranoia, was in fact being followed by detectives, who had been hired by his family. 
 However tragic the circumstances, there is no lack of humor here, some of it in Beam's wry asides, much of it implicit in the deadpan choice of material and in a penchant for understatement on the part of the authorities. Even the patients themselves, it seems, recognized the entertainment value in their surroundings. In 1958, they wrote and staged a musical, ''Close to Home,'' an hourlong parody of life at the Belmont Hill Bettering House, where Andy, a protagonist with a drinking problem, undergoes the psychoanalytic scrutiny of the staff and in the end finds romance with another patient, culminating in a lyrical duet, ''In Love, Sort Of.'' The show was a triumph, playing to packed houses on three evenings, and was taken on the road to the Austen Riggs sanitarium in Stockbridge, Mass. The librettist, Beam tells us, later committed suicide. 
 These high jinks are a far cry from Lowell's experience, judging from the plaintive references to McLean that made their way into his work and from accounts by members of the staff and fellow inmates. In his manic phases, he devoted himself to fruitless exercises like rewriting famous poems in the Norton Anthology; in the throes of depression, he underwent electroshock treatments. Plath commemorated her stay at McLean in her autobiographical novel, ''The Bell Jar.'' Four years after her release, she noted in her journal that a recent issue of Cosmopolitan contained two articles about mental health: ''I must write one about a college girl suicide,'' she wrote. ''And a story, a novel even. . . . There is an increasing market for mental-hospital stuff. I am a fool if I don't relive, recreate it.'' Little did she know just how large that market would become. Kaysen, Andrew Solomon, Emily Fox Gordon, Elizabeth Wurtzel and others have lately documented their journey to the brink of despair and back in accounts influenced by Plath's, Lowell's and Sexton's examples, even when those examples are not invoked. 
 This new generation of memoirs, and to a certain degree this book, promulgates an idea of madness more becoming and more easily digestible than the confounding, occasionally horrific reality. It's hard to reconcile the setting of ''Gracefully Insane'' -- the luxurious appointments, the pastoral surroundings, the lovable eccentrics -- with the desolate interior landscape of the mentally ill, which Beam makes no attempt to convey. For that, the reader must turn to William Styron, whose brutally straightforward ''Darkness Visible'' manages to capture the full force of the suffering: the isolation, the tedium, the life gone stale. Beam's guided tour bypasses the schizophrenics, the drug addicts and any number of other less picturesque patients, like those prone to violence and in need of restraining. On the basis of ''Gracefully Insane,'' the reader might conclude that bluebloods make a better class of mental patient: even with a few screws loose, their manners are intact. 
 Strapped for cash and grappling for market share in the era of managed care, McLean is now headed the way of other once-august American institutions, its decline hastened by the advent of new drugs, most famously Prozac, that have shortened hospital stays and relegated certain mental illnesses to the outpatient clinics. At the start, Beam reports the board of directors' decision to sell off half of McLean's 250 acres in order to survive, and coming to the end of this lively account the reader can't help feeling a certain nostalgia and regret.

 AMID the surfeit of performances of Handel's ''Messiah'' in New York every December, one has consistently stood out in recent years. The annual presentation by the St. Thomas Choir of Men and Boys and the period-instrument Concert Royal, conducted by Gerre Hancock, is typically considered the best of the lot. So it is a happy occasion when these performers busy themselves ''off season'' with another Baroque monument, as they do on Tuesday in Bach's ''St. Matthew Passion'' (very much in season, of course). 
 This account of the final hours and death of Jesus, surely one of Bach's greatest works, has escaped controversy like that surrounding his ''St. John Passion'' for a perceived anti-Semitism in the text if not in the music. The performance, at St. Thomas Church Fifth Avenue, at 53rd Street, celebrates Mr. Hancock's 30th anniversary as organist and master of choristers there. Mark Bleeke sings the Evangelist; Woodrow Bynum, Jesus. Other soloists include boys from the choir in treble roles. 
 Listeners who find themselves an hour or two west of Manhattan can find a notable ''St. Matthew'' closer to hand, in Bethlehem, Pa. The Bach Choir of Bethlehem has been celebrating its namesake through rapidly changing musical times for more than a century, most notably in an annual festival in May. Here Greg Funfgeld, the group's music director, conducts a seasonal performance in Packer Memorial Church at Lehigh University. 
 To judge from the work of the choir and the Bach Festival Orchestra at the festival in 1998 and at Carnegie Hall in 2000, this will be a more traditional affair, with a large mixed chorus and female as well as male soloists. Yet it should also be eminently respectable on its own terms. The vocal soloists include Frederick Urrey as the Evangelist and Gary Relyea as Jesus.

 Political leaders in Washington are casting about for measures to ensure that the Enron debacle will never be repeated. Unfortunately, one of the main ideas being considered -- requiring companies to treat stock options as expenses on financial statements -- addresses an issue that not only had nothing to do with Enron's failure but is, in fact, not a problem at all. 
 The proper purpose of any reform should be a clearer, more accurate picture of a company's financial health. Instead, counting options as expenses -- ''expensing'' them -- would actually distort and confuse that picture considerably. It could also prevent millions of workers from sharing in the success of their firms through employee ownership. 
 Stock options give employees the future right to purchase shares at a predetermined price. When employees exercise and sell options, they get the difference between the option price and the market price of the stock. When an option is exercised, a company's total number of shares increases, thereby reducing earnings per share. And while salaries reduce a company's cash, options do not. When options are exercised, cash actually increases by the exercise price paid by the worker. This debate is about how an employee's potential gain is recorded in financial statements. 
 Current accounting rules correctly require that companies report their earnings per share on a diluted basis (i.e., counting the potential decrease in the ownership of existing shareholders due to the granting and exercise of stock options). If expensing were also required, the impact of options would be counted twice in the earnings per share: first as a potential dilution of earnings, by increasing the shares outstanding, and second as a charge against reported earnings. The result would be inaccurate and misleading earnings per share. 
 Another difficulty with proposals to expense options is that there exists no remotely accurate way to calculate the expense. Some proposals would expense options when they are granted -- without knowing whether the worker will ever exercise the options or what the future stock price will be. Other proposals would expense options when exercised, with any increase in the stock price over the option price being subtracted from otherwise reported profits. Thus, the better the company's stock performs, the worse the company's earnings will look. Surely, this makes no sense. 
 Accounting rules already require companies to disclose detailed information about their stock option programs. If new stock option legislation were enacted, the misleading understatement of corporate earnings would make it prohibitively expensive for most firms to continue broad stock option programs. 
 This would be a terrible mistake. Stock options have been crucial to venture-capital-backed companies that have created more than seven million jobs over 30 years and generated more than $1.3 trillion in revenue in 2000 alone. Today 90 percent of large companies issue stock options. 
 Options embody a principle that the Enron scandal does nothing to diminish: that the financial interests and responsibility of workers, management and investors be aligned. Not only executives are rewarded with options; last year 10 million American workers got them, and according to a 2000 survey, 44 percent of the companies that have options programs make grants to all employees. 
 Proponents of legislation to expense stock options believe that Enron's cooked books had something to do with stock options. We disagree. Such legislation would only encourage misleading financial statements. There are legitimate public policy responses to the Enron debacle. Expensing stock options isn't one of them.

"381","Unapproved Canola Seed May Be on Farms, Makers Say",1384562,"|business",16,4,2002,"20020416T000000","|Canada"," 
 Monsanto and Aventis CropScience said yesterday that some genetically modified canola seeds that have not been approved in the United States might have found their way to farmers' fields. The two companies are now seeking regulatory approval of those seeds to prevent possible recalls of seeds or food. 
 The canola does not appear to present a health threat. While the Aventis canola has not been approved for planting in the United States, it is approved for food use when imported directly to food processing factories from Canada. The Monsanto crop has not been approved for food use, but the Food and Drug Administration said yesterday that it deemed the canola safe. 
 Still, the incidents are expected to raise further concerns about the difficulty of isolating genetically modified crops from others because of cross-pollination or the mixing of seeds in processing or during shipment. The biotechnology and agriculture industries are still reeling from the costly food recalls that ensued when a type of genetically engineered corn not approved for human consumption found its way into taco shells and other foods in 2000. 
 A Monsanto spokesman said the company had not detected the unapproved canola seeds in the seeds it sells in the United States. Aventis CropScience, which developed the corn involved in the recalls two years ago, would not say whether it had found its unapproved canola in the seeds it was selling in this country. 
 The Monsanto canola, known as GT-200, is resistant to its Roundup herbicide, enabling farmers to spray herbicide on the crop to kill weeds without harming the crop. Monsanto decided not to commercialize GT-200 in favor of a slightly different version of Roundup Ready canola. 
 But the GT-200 seeds keep showing up anyway. In 1997, Monsanto recalled thousands of bags of canola seed in Canada, which grows far more canola than the United States, because they contained GT-200. By last year, GT-200 had been approved in Canada, but not in overseas markets, potentially hurting Canadian exports, so Monsanto recalled more canola seed in Canada because it contained GT-200. 
 At that time, Monsanto said it would work to get GT-200 approved in other markets. It is now following through, asking the Department of Agriculture to allow the seeds to be planted, not because Monsanto intends to market them but to prevent disruptions to the food system. Monsanto's actions were first reported yesterday by The Wall Street Journal. 
 Aventis CropScience, which is being sold by Aventis to Bayer, has also applied for approval for its canola. The Agriculture Department is studying public comments and has not made a decision, but it has proposed approving both companies' crops. 
 Joseph Mendelson III, legal director for the Center for Food Safety in Washington, a consumer group critical of genetically modified foods, said the companies were ''seeking post-hoc approval, to cover liability, I think.'' He said that since the seed was showing up in Canada, the companies ''should have known that this is probably making it onto the U.S. market, too.'' 
 The presence of the Monsanto canola in food, if it were to be found, would not necessarily prompt recalls because there is no federal approval required for food use of genetically modified crops that do not contain pesticides. The corn that led to the food recalls two years ago contained a pesticide and was therefore subject to regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
 Laura Tarantino, deputy director of the F.D.A. office of food additive safety, said the agency had reviewed safety data submitted voluntarily by Monsanto and had ''no safety questions and no safety issues with it.''"

 PATTY ANDERSON and her husband, Gary, found faith where they least expected it -- he on the free-throw line and she swathed in sweats in an aerobics class. 
 It happened at the 50,000-square-foot activities center of the Southeast Christian Church here, where pumping iron and praising the Lord go hand and hand. Amenities at the gym include 16 basketball courts and a Cybex health club, free to churchgoers, where the music is Christian and the rules ban cursing even during the crunch. 
 ''I really had no intention of being part of a church,'' recalled Gary Anderson, a physiology professor at the University of Louisville School of Medicine. But hoops at this 22,000-member megachurch led him to the sanctuary. And after three years, he said, like a slam dunk, ''the sermons sunk in.'' 
 Southeast Christian is an example of a new breed of megachurch -- a full-service ''24/7'' sprawling village, which offers many of the conveniences and trappings of secular life wrapped around a spiritual core. It is possible to eat, shop, go to school, bank, work out, scale a rock-climbing wall and pray there, all without leaving the grounds. 
 These churches are becoming civic in a way unimaginable since the 13th century and its cathedral towns. No longer simply places to worship, they have become part resort, part mall, part extended family and part town square. 
 In Glendale, Ariz., the 12,000-member Community Church of Joy, which has a school, conference center, bookstore and mortuary on its 187-acre property, has embarked on a $100 million campaign to build a housing development, a hotel, convention center, skate park and water-slide park, transforming itself into what Dr. Walt Kallestad, the senior pastor, calls a ''destination center.'' 
 The churches have even become alternative employers. At the Brentwood Baptist Church in Houston, a McDonald's will open this month, complete with a drive-in window and small golden arches. Part of its goal is to create jobs for young people and the elderly, while offering a predominantly middle-class black congregation another reason to linger on church grounds. 
 By making it nearly possible to inhabit the church from morning to night, cradle to grave, these full-service churches can shelter congregants, said Dr. Randall Ballmer, a professor of American religion at Barnard College, from ''a broader society that seems unsafe, unpredictable and out of control, underscored by school shootings and terrorism.'' 
 While some scholars and communities are concerned about the megascale of the churches, and the civic responsibility they assume, 24/7 churches reflect a broad cultural desire for rootedness and convenience for overextended families. And in stark contrast to the issues roiling the big traditional churches, these churches, which are largely evangelical, offer relief from stresses on American family life, including suburban sprawl, with its vast commutes, and ''drugs, crime and other youthful temptations,'' said Dr. Joe Samuel Ratliff, pastor of Brentwood Baptist. It was he who advocated the McDonald's at Brentwood as a way to ''create a controlled, protective setting for our kids.'' 
 The churches reflect a desire by congregants for ''a universe where everything from the temperature to the theology is safely controlled,'' Dr. Ballmer said. ''They don't have to worry about finding schools, social networks or a place to eat. It's all prepackaged.'' 
 Though many of the churches, which are largely in the South and Midwest, are involved in missionary work, their congregants may be able to isolate themselves from the greater community -- to engage in a kind of ''Christian cocooning,'' said Dr. Bill J. Leonard, dean and professor of church history at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C. 
 Yet, church leaders say, their aim is not isolation but comfort and convenience for harried families. With their numerous ports of entry, from gyms to singles cafes, full-service churches make it easy to come and stay, they say. 
 The staying part has proved trickiest for religious institutions. Adult churchgoers, at the rate of one in six, ''church-hop, based on their need du jour,'' said David Kinnaman, vice president of Barna Research, one of the new consulting firms helping these churches grow. One in seven will leave a church this year. 
 ''People are looking at churches with a similar cost-benefit analysis they'd give to any other consumer purchase,'' Mr. Kinnaman said. ''There is little brand loyalty. Many are looking for the newest and the greatest.'' 
 Dave Stone, the associate minister of Southeast, calls his church, which is open daily from 5:30 a.m. to 11 p.m., ''a refueling station.'' 
 ''If we can get people to come to our gym,'' he explained, ''it's only a matter of time before we can get them to visit our sanctuary.'' 
 The church was deliberately designed like a mall. (The sanctuary is the anchor tenant.) Hallways 20 feet wide with curves enhance ''people flow,'' said Jack Coffee, a church elder and chairman of the building committee. Preschoolers frolic at a Disneyesque play land, with mazes. There is an education wing for Bible classes, a concert-hall-size atrium with glass elevators, crisscrossing escalators and giant monitors that itemize the day's offerings: meetings to help smokers quit, a cross-trainers minimarathon and pat the Bible classes for 6-month-olds. 
 Such amenities are typically paid for by the congregation with three-year capital campaigns, on top of the church's operating budget, which is often financed with tithes, said Malcolm P. Graham, president of Cargill Associates' church division, a fund-raising consultant. A study by the Hartford Institute for Religion Research at the Hartford Seminary, finds the average annual income for a megachurch is $4.6 million a year. Annual contributions to Southeast Christian are more than $20 million. 
 Southeast Christian churchgoers speak of a 22,000-person family, and visitors are regaled with statistics: the coffeepot that serves 5,000 cups an hour, the 403 toilets. Southeast's size has spawned the invention of the Greenlee Communion Dispensing Machine, designed by Wilfred Greenlee, 79, a congregant. It can fill 40 communion cups in 2 seconds. 
 For Fellowship Church in Grapevine, Tex., attracting young congregants, and keeping them, has helped it grow from 30 families to 20,000 members in a dozen years. Fellowship offers a 40,000-square-foot youth center with a climbing wall and video arcade and is creating a lake to encourage father-son bass fishing. 
 Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, Tex., has a youth center so elaborate that some have called it Preston World: 15 ball fields, a 1950's-style diner and a fitness center, as well as classrooms and a 7,000-seat sanctuary. It is adding a $19 million school, coffee shop, food court, student ministry center, youth building, an outdoor prayer walk, a chapel and an indoor commons, modeled on the idea of Main Street. ''We're not a large church,'' said Mike Basta, the executive pastor. ''We're a small town.'' 
 Brentwood Baptist in Houston also offers a full range of family options, often based on a political and social agenda. Besides its choir and Bible-study classes, it has housing for AIDS patients and a credit union. 
 In this supersize church, the new McDonald's is not just an investment for the congregation -- the church has put $100,000 into the for-profit franchise -- but also a way to create jobs and generate money for scholarships and community programs. (McDonald's gets its standard 4 percent from sales.) 
 Not incidentally, it gives the 2,000 or so Brentwood congregants who flock to church for more than 80 activities each evening -- like children's theater and adult computer classes -- an excuse to stick around. ''If you have to go home for dinner, you don't come back out,'' Pastor Ratliff said, referring in part to the city's vast commutes. 
 But some scholars and municipalities are troubled by the civic expansion of 24/7 churches. They are becoming ''a parallel universe that's Christianized,'' in the words of Dr. Scott Thumma, a sociologist of religion at the Hartford Institute. 
 Dr. Wade Clark Roof, a professor of religion and society at the University of California at Santa Barbara, said he worried that full-service churches are ''the religious version of the gated community.'' 
 ''It's an attempt to create a world where you're dealing with like-minded people,'' he said. ''You lose the dialogue with the larger culture.'' 
 Marci Hamilton, a professor of constitutional law at Benjamin Cardozo Law School in New York, said that church growth and in some cases, the expansion of megasynagogues, Mormon temples and mainline churches has become contentious locally, especially in residential neighborhoods upset about ''intensity of use.'' The full-service churches virtually never sleep, drawing cars, crowds and even bright spotlights at all hours and on any day. 
 Tensions between church and state were highlighted by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Person Act, passed by Congress two years ago, which prevents government agencies, including local planning boards, from blocking church projects unless a compelling government interest is at stake. Municipalities around the country are ''wrestling with the question of what the new law allows them to do or not to do,'' said Jim Schwab, a senior research associate with the American Planning Association in Chicago. 
 The town within a town being fashioned by the Community Church of Joy in suburban Phoenix will let members live on church grounds and even be buried there, venturing outside perhaps only to work and buy groceries. Even the water park, which will be part of an Olympic-size aquatic center, will have a Christian theme, with laser shows depicting Jonah and the whale and David and Goliath. The housing development, which will not be limited to church members, will have a full-time chaplain. Though not meant to replicate Disneyland, it is a Disneyesque utopian vision with a Christian spin. 
 ''People are longing for morals, values and ethics,'' Dr. Kallestad said. ''It's not isolation. It's insulation.''"

 FINAL exams end on Wednesday and students are packing up to head home. Commencement, which is scheduled for Friday, normally marks the end of the annual process by which the State University of New York at Stony Brook cocoons itself for the summer, re-emerging in September as a bustling campus with more than 34,000 students, faculty and staff. 
 But this year the summertime academic lull will not mean peace and quiet. While seniors try on graduation gowns and prepare to walk across the stage toward their futures, bulldozers and backhoes wait in the wings to change the look of their alma mater. 
 Projects to transform academic buildings, landscapes, roadways and leisure centers will turn SUNY-Stony Brook into a giant construction site. School officials say that when the students return in September, the notoriously gray and uninviting collection of buildings dating from the 60's, when the school opened, will be prettified. Or, if the projects fall behind schedule, there will be chaos. 
 Major construction plans include overhauling the front of the Staller Center for the Arts, a venue for university and professional concerts and theater events. The Humanities Building, which houses the school's English department, will be renovated and enlarged. The 100,000-square-foot Charles B. Wang Asian American Center, a gift of the Computer Associates executive and Islanders owner, is also scheduled for completion before school reopens in the fall. 
 ''Quality of space is very important to learning,'' said Shirley Strum Kenny, the university's president. ''What we've achieved so far has already given students a greater sense of self-respect. The campus's ongoing transformation is already positively affecting the quality of students we attract.'' 
 The school also plans to complete a new sports stadium to accommodate its football and lacrosse teams, which were moved up in the National Collegiate Athletic Association classification from Division II to Division I in 1999 and joined the America East Conference this year. The Sea Hawks' new home will seat 7,500. 
 Not everything is being done this summer. Recently completed additions include an ambulatory surgery center fronting Nicolls Road that opened in March as a new addition to the University Hospital. A child care center for university workers was opened last fall along Stony Brook Road. 
 Off campus, private donations are funding the restoration of Sunwood, the home of Ward Melville, the philanthropist whose 478-acre land donation brought SUNY to Stony Brook village. A new Sunwood, replacing the original home that burned in 1987, is to serve as a residence for the university president as well as a reception and meeting center for some university events. 
 Stony Brook University's expansion even extends into New York City. This year the college opened a Manhattan branch on Park Avenue South as a way to give students a taste of the city. School officials expect 800 students there in the fall. 
 The campus construction plans that are not big and ambitious have value beyond their size. The destruction of a footbridge over the school's main road that connects the library to a dead end on the second floor of the student union is eagerly awaited. Plagued by surface ruptures and stress cracks, the so-called ''bridge to nowhere'' is considered unsafe and is often closed in inclement weather. 
 ''That bridge was symbol of the fame Stony Brook garnered in its early days as ugly and dysfunctional,'' said Aaron Godfrey, a lecturer in classics and European languages at the university for a quarter century. ''It represented the disconnect between the students and administration, and the administration and the state construction fund in Albany.'' 
 Dr. Godfrey said the school's architectural style was often described as ''neo-penal.'' 
 Robert Reuter, an architect and industrial engineer and Stony Brook native, says he remembers the school's early construction. 
 ''I think that originally the community was quite excited about having the university here, but almost immediately it was universally derided for its architecture,'' he said. ''The quality of building and planning was seen as an unfortunate joke. It didn't adhere in any way to the wishes of Ward Melville.'' 
 Mr. Melville, owner of the Thom McAn shoe stores, envisioned Stony Brook as a small liberal arts college with a colonial architecture in keeping with the Three Village area, which he did much to preserve through the Ward Melville Heritage Organization, which owns several historic buildings. But the only campus structure with a colonial architecture is the new day care center. 
 Dr. Kenny said that when she arrived in Stony Brook in 1995, ''there just wasn't money for major renovations, but something had to be done. We started with ornamental plantings on the mall area, which had never been anything but blacktop. We added grass and trees and benches to make the area more inviting.'' 
 Today the mall features a large fountain and a manmade brook. 
 Dormitories had been another longstanding problem. 
 ''The dorms were depressing and dark without any welcoming common areas,'' said Dallas Bauman, assistant vice president for campus residences. Mr. Bauman said residence halls had exposed piping in the ceilings, mismatched linoleum floor tiles and no security system. 
 An $81 million infusion of state money some five years ago allowed the school to renovate all existing dorms and build new ones. Today there are 8,000 resident beds, up nearly 2,000 from the 1980's. 
 ''The new dorms are much bigger and nicer,'' said Veronique Antunez, a junior who transferred from Adelphi University in Garden City. ''There are a lot of living options here and the halls are stylish, not cramped and small.'' 
 Millie Aponte is a junior who remembers visiting her older brother at Stony Brook years ago, before she also transferred to the school from the College of New Rochelle. 
 ''It's much better here now,'' she said. ''There's less asphalt and a lot more grass. Now that they are fixing a lot of the buildings, it's a campus you can be proud of.'' 
 But many of the neighbors are unimpressed. Valerie Vignona used to live in the Long Hill neighborhood adjacent to the school's new undergraduate apartments. Three years ago, the Vignona family moved to another part of Stony Brook in part because of problems they experienced living next to the university. 
 ''When we moved into that community there was a nice stand of trees separating us from the school's residence halls, but when they started building new dorms they tore all the trees out,'' Ms. Vignona said. ''With the dorms so close we got rats and mice and noise.'' 
 Ms. Vignona said that school-related congestion along Stony Brook Road, which borders the campus to the west and is the only access to the Long Hill area, makes traffic unbearable. 
 Dr. Kenny acknowledged that town-gown relations have not always been smooth. 
 ''The university hasn't always been warmly received, whether because of architecture or scope or size,'' she said. ''Truthfully, I don't think anyone could have welcomed such large and massive construction in their backyard. We have made serious efforts to ameliorate that antipathy.'' 
 President Kenny said she believed beautification efforts at the university pleased the surrounding community and encouraged interaction. Other plans with that goal in mind include cutting a straight thoroughfare from the university's main entrance on Nicolls Road to the central area of campus. 
 The road would feature ornamental plantings and culminate at the circular drive around administration buildings, the Staller Center and the Asian American Center, all of which would become visible from the main roadway. Currently trees block the view of the university center from the road. 
 Although money hasn't yet been allocated for this plan, Dr. Kenny said she hoped it would be started in the next few years. 
 ''The new entrance will relieve current traffic congestion at the school's main entrance without widening Nicolls Road, which has been a matter of community concern,'' she said. ''I don't think people will object because there won't be more roadway, just better roadway.'' 
 In fact, community resistance to the plan has already risen. 
 ''When Ward Melville laid out this area, Nicolls Road was supposed to be a pristine corridor,'' said Ken Sunberg, president of the civic association in Setauket, which with Stony Brook and Poquott comprise the Three Villages. ''With ongoing university developments, Nicolls Road is in danger of becoming deforested into a large commercial strip, which is not in keeping with the feel of this area.'' 
 Another longstanding sore point between SUNY and the community has been how the college disposes of its sewage. Currently, the school's waste is treated and dumped into Port Jefferson Harbor via a huge pipe running under 25A. 
 ''Now that there are more buildings with more usage, there will be more sewage being dumped into the Sound,'' Mr. Sunberg said. ''They are maximizing use of that pipe already and they are not generally adding new pipes or facilities to treat the waste.'' 
 Iva Kocijan, the university's spokeswoman, said the school was looking for different answers to sewage treatment. ''We don't plan to send any more to Port Jefferson,'' she said. ''We're exploring various solutions, one of which is containment and treatment on campus.'' 
 Mr. Sunberg said university officials had informed his group of the school's intention to put a seven-floor hotel near the main entrance on Nicolls Road. 
 ''We did talk about building a conference center-hotel complex, but at this point we have no plans to do so,'' Ms. Kocijan said. 
 Such mixed messages tend to set some neighbors' teeth on edge. ''We have no sense of stability since the school is not always forthright about their plans,'' Mr. Sunberg said.

"385","Ontario Trims Plan for a Privatization",1400202,"|business",13,6,2002,"20020613T000000","|Canada|Ontario (Canada)|Canada"," 
 Ontario's conservative government backtracked today on plans for the total privatization of Hydro One Inc., the province's dominant power-distribution company. 
 The privatization, which was originally scheduled to take place this month through a public stock offering, would have been the biggest in Canadian history, with a value of about 5.5 billion Canadian dollars ($3.6 billion). BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc., RBC Dominion Securities Inc. and Goldman, Sachs were named earlier as the lead underwriters. 
 Ernie Eves, who took over as the province's premier last month, said the province would retain a stake of at least 51 percent in Hydro One. The government is still considering selling up to 49 percent, or it may set up an income trust, he said. 
 In April, the government's opponents successfully petitioned a court to stall Hydro One's planned privatization."
"386","Drug Industry Sues Over Limiting Medicaid Costs",1405251,"|health|u.s.|washington",2,7,2002,"20020702T000000",NA," 
 The pharmaceutical industry has sued the Bush administration, challenging its approval of state Medicaid laws that try to save money by restricting access to higher-cost prescription drugs. 
 At issue is a Michigan program approved in January by Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services. A major purpose of the program is to extract discounts from prescription drug manufacturers. 
 The plaintiff in the lawsuit, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade association for drug companies, said the Michigan program ''restricts access to medicines for America's most vulnerable patients,'' in violation of the federal Medicaid law. 
 Jan Faiks, a lawyer at the association, said 11 other states had passed laws or announced plans to restrict access to medicines for Medicaid recipients in similar ways. 
 In the lawsuit, filed on Friday in Federal District Court here, drug companies sought a preliminary injunction to halt the programs in Michigan and the other states. 
 The lawsuit highlights a growing conflict between drug companies and many states. 
 Medicaid, the insurance program for 44 million low-income people, is financed with federal and state money. Medicaid spending on prescription drugs has been rising 15 percent to 20 percent a year, but state revenues have been flat or declining. 
 President Bush and other administration officials have promised to give states greater leeway in controlling costs. 
 The Michigan program penalizes drug companies unless they give the state extra discounts, beyond the 15 percent reduction ordinarily required under Medicaid. The penalty reduces drug sales for any company that refuses to give Michigan the extra discounts. Doctors who want to prescribe drugs made by such a company must get approval from the state. 
 Doctors find this authorization requirement onerous, so sales of drugs subject to the requirement decline precipitously. 
 Nationwide, Medicaid accounts for at least $20 billion a year in prescription drug sales, or about 15 percent of total sales. 
 The drug industry often prefers Republican candidates for public office. But the lawsuit puts the industry in the position of attacking Republicans, including the Bush administration; the governor of Michigan, John Engler; and the governor of Florida, Jeb Bush. 
 Geralyn A. Lasher, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Community Health, said Michigan spent $1 billion a year, more than $19 million a week, on prescription drugs for low-income people and the elderly. The discount program, Ms. Lasher said, saves $600,000 a week. 
 ''It is not surprising that the pharmaceutical lobbyists have filed a lawsuit to stop states from prudently managing the cost of care,'' she said. 
 William A. Pierce, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said: ''Our lawyers have reviewed the lawsuit. We firmly believe that Secretary Thompson had the authority to take the action he took.'' 
 But Ms. Faiks, the lawyer for the drug companies, said: ''States are putting bureaucrats and bean counters in charge of their Medicaid drug programs. They are forcing Medicaid patients to settle for older, less expensive, less effective medicines.'' 
 Ray Hanley, the Medicaid director in Arkansas, who is also chairman of the National Association of State Medicaid Directors, said: ''The implication that states are trying to push Medicaid recipients onto the cheapest, oldest drugs to save money is outrageous. In developing lists of preferred drugs, states have put a lot of time and effort into determining what is clinically appropriate. Cost has been secondary.'' 
 Under the federal Medicaid law, states can exclude medications from a list of preferred drugs only if they offer no ''therapeutic advantage'' over products already on the list."

 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show. 
 Museums 
 * ''THE AGE OF IMPRESSIONISM: EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE ORDRUPGAARD COLLECTION, COPENHAGEN,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sept. 8). Said to be the most important holding of 19th-century French paintings in northern Europe, the Ordrupgaard Collection was assembled in the early 20th century by Wilhelm Hansen (1868-1936), a Danish insurance magnate. With works in depth by Gauguin, Degas, Pissarro, Monet, Renoir and Sisley and treasures by Manet, Matisse, Cézanne and others, the collection, now owned by the state, is ensconced at Hansen's former country home outside Copenhagen, along with a fine group of paintings by Danish artists of Hansen's day and earlier. At the Met, the Danish and French collections are shown in separate galleries. The larger French section has true delights, among them a lively Fauve still life by Matisse from 1909, a rare Polynesian-flavored Gauguin portrait of 1896 and a great Pissarro representation, including a powerful evocation of springtime painted at his home in Éragny, France, in 1894. The most interesting of the Danish artists is Vilhelm Hammershoi, the last of the great 19th-century Danish painters, whose spare, somber interiors and portraits -- untouched by modernism -- have recently returned to critical consciousness. Altogether, the 84 paintings make a real banquet. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Grace Glueck). 
 ''AMERICAN ANTHEM: MASTERWORKS FROM THE AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM,'' 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040 (through Jan. 5). The last in a trio of shows celebrating the American Folk Art Museum's new building, ''Anthem'' displays more than 250 objects from among those acquired since the museum began 40 years ago. And in the museum's cleverly designed new digs, the show really comes on strong. It displays some of folk art's most esteemed icons, among them the ''Flag Gate,'' a weathered farm gate of painted wood in the shape of an American flag; a pair of spiffy lady-gentleman portraits by Ammi Phillips; a spirited carousel horse from Coney Island carved by Charles Carmel; and a life-size baseball player at bat, carved by Samuel Anderson Robb. For the first time, too, the show includes the work of 20th-century self-taught artists in context with earlier folk art in the collection. Also for the first time, the museum demonstrates its recently expanded collecting interests beyond the United States, showing the work of 20th-century self-taught Europeans like Adolf Wolfli, Madge Gill and Carlo Zinelli. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $9; $5, students and 62+ (Glueck) 
 * ''DAVID TO CÉZANNE: 19TH-CENTURY FRENCH DRAWINGS,'' Pierpont Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0610 (through Sept. 8). With this exciting show, the Morgan, best known for the excellence of its Dutch and Flemish works on paper, makes its first large-scale foray into 19th-century French drawings. The 106 works trace the last hurrah of the academic tradition and the dazzling drawing skills it spawned through several generations of extraordinary talent and artistic innovations, from Neo-Classicism to the doorstep of Neo-Impressionism. The works have been selected and installed with an eye to fascinating comparisons and drawing's diverse mediums and uses. Giants like Ingres, Degas, Delacroix and Cézanne are generously represented, but some wonderful unknowns like Charles Damour and Léon Bonvin (the creator of a heavenly little twig-by-twig farm scene) are also introduced. Within the blur of versatility and mutating styles, nearly every work establishes its own still point, and one of drawing's golden ages is vividly evoked. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, to 8 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6 for students and 65+ (Roberta Smith). 
 * ''THOMAS EAKINS,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sept. 15). It remains nearly impossible to see America, or at least to look back on the country in the 19th century, without some refraction through Eakins's art. He painted, hands down, the finest 19th-century American painting, ''The Gross Clinic,'' which by itself justifies leaving your home right now and visiting the Met. His sentiments always ran deep below the surface, but they bubbled up in ways even he didn't necessarily seem to realize, or didn't want to acknowledge. The strong current of homoeroticism throughout his work is the obvious example. The show comes with two discoveries: that Eakins occasionally projected photographs with the aid of a magic lantern and traced the projections; and that he often began paintings by putting down bright colors, but then added subtle glazes of brown or black to give the pictures evenness and sobriety, a process overlooked or misunderstood by restorers in the past. Both discoveries help us see afresh this classic figure, who seems as interesting for being uneven and unpredictable as he is for his familiar commitment to unvarnished reality. His most American quality, in the end, may not be his scientific sensibility or pioneering choice of subjects or any other cliché of nationalism, but this combination of dogged, plain-spoken, almost puritanical realism with a simmering, unconventional character. Hours and admission: See above (Michael Kimmelman). 
 * ''GAUGUIN IN NEW YORK COLLECTIONS: THE LURE OF THE EXOTIC,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Oct. 20). The first major New York exhibition devoted to Gauguin in four decades isn't major-major by Met blockbuster standards: more than half of the 120 pieces are drawings and prints. But these are pretty spectacular, and they are joined by some two dozen paintings, including coral-and-mango-colored visions of a mythical South Pacific that are among the most beautiful images created by any modern artist. Only the Met has the resources to put this kind of material together, though if you want to get a real sense of the not-so-nice artist himself, check out the new critical biography by Nancy Mowll Mathews, ''Paul Gauguin: An Erotic Life.'' Hours and admission: See above (Holland Cotter). 
 * ''FRIDA KAHLO, DIEGO RIVERA AND 20TH-CENTURY MEXICAN ART: THE JACQUES AND NATASHA GELMAN COLLECTION,'' El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272 (through Sept. 8). El Museo began in an East Harlem storefront; now it's a capstone of Museum Mile with a show that many a larger, richer museum would welcome. Kahlo is a big part of the attraction. Seven of her self-portraits are here, reason enough for a pilgrimage. Sure, she's been oversold, but she's great. Her husband, Diego Rivera, looks good, too, with his visionary ''Calla Lily Vendor'' and a slinky portrait of Natasha Gelman that is pure tinseltown luxe. There are, in fact, too many Gelman portraits on hand, along with some other second-tier work, but with so much else of interest the show is a must-see even for museumgoers who usually stick to the mainstream. Those for whom Kahlo is the She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed of modernist painting are no doubt lining up at the door. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays, to 9 p.m. Admission: $7; $3 for students and 65+ (Cotter). 
 * ''MEXICO CITY: AN EXHIBITION ABOUT THE EXCHANGE RATES OF BODIES AND VALUES,'' P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through September). Mexico City has an extremely happening art scene. This exhibition of largely conceptual pieces by 17 young artists either born or based there looks sparse and uneven as it has been installed, but it is full of interesting -- in one case deeply disturbing and ethically challenging -- work. Anyone expecting an upbeat, fiesta atmosphere will be disappointed: the predominant subjects here are poverty, decay and human predation, with moments of tenderness and humor glinting through. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2 for students and 62+ (Cotter). 
 ''MOVING PICTURES,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue at 88th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 12). This survey of photography appended with a small selection of video, film and installation art may be the largest exhibition at its kind in a major New York museum. Drawn almost entirely from the Guggenheim's permanent collection, it has a snappy yet unobtrusive design by Hani Rashid and capably surveys the expansion of contemporary art by various camera-dependent media from the late 1960's to the present. It begins with works by Nam June Paik, Bruce Naumann and Robert Smithson, then moves up the museum's ramp through photographs by Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and Andreas Gursky, concluding with video and film by artists like Stan Douglas, Shirin Neshat and Pierre Huyghe. An added attraction are the foam-lined, cave-like video galleries perched at the top of the spiral, which give the show a giddy, Hall-of-the-Mountain-King finale that seems to say ''onward and upward with video.'' Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $9, students and 65+ (Smith) 
 * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, QUEENS, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400. The Modern's new temporary home (until 2005) has finally opened in the former Swingline staple factory with part of its permanent collection of paintings and sculpture on view along with a few summer shows, including a contemporary survey called ''Tempo.'' The galleries approximate the classic industrial loft aesthetic, efficient and airless, like the inside of a storage center, which is exactly what this building is, but touching for Cézannes, Seurats and Braques, which suddenly look fresh and by contrast seem to pop off the movable bare white walls. The shows include ''Autobodies,'' five gorgeous automobiles from the museum's collection, and a display of Rudy Burckhardt's little-known photographs of Queens in the late 1930's and early 40's, a perfect tribute to the museum's new locale. ''Tempo,'' a wide-ranging, global-minded, erratically engaging and fuzzily conceived effort, is supposed to have something to do with movement, change, impermanence, the museum's migration and modernism's condition. It's all vague, but approached modestly it's fine, with good art and bad. The trip to the museum couldn't be easier on the No. 7 subway. Now you can tell everyone you're chic. You've been to Queens. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m; to 7:45 p.m. on Fridays. Admission: $12; $8.50 for students and 65+ (Kimmelman). 
 ''CLAES OLDENBURG DRAWINGS, 1959-77'' AND ''CLAES OLDENBURG WITH COOSJE VAN BRUGGEN DRAWINGS, 1992-98,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Sept. 15). One of the most original draftsmen around is Claes Oldenburg, whose early sculptures of everyday objects in the 1960's helped to define the Pop art movement. His startling ability to perceive subtle visual relationships among objects and to morph them from one incarnation or state to another is on view in 92 drawings now owned by the Whitney, including 18 done in collaboration with his wife, Coosje van Bruggen. The show is said to be the largest ever mounted of Mr. Oldenberg's works on paper. The drawings, anthropomorphic, often erotic and always full of life, are brilliantly rendered in the cheerfully loose yet energetic Oldenburg style that gives inanimate objects a kind of body language, or attitude, if you will. He is at the top of his form in the proposals for monuments he began in the 1960's, like the gigantic ironing board looming over the Lower East Side of Manhattan (1965) and the cathedral in the form of a colossal faucet for Lake Union, Seattle (1972). But altogether the show is a fine celebration of the Oldenburg wizardry in extracting the extraordinary from the everyday. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+ (Glueck). 
 * ''THE PAINTINGS OF JOAN MITCHELL,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Sept. 29). The impact of Mitchell's works, especially the later ones (she died of lung cancer 10 years ago, at 66), is so immediately intoxicating that a natural reaction is to distrust the art. Abstract paintings this suave and sure-footed must be glib and manipulative, you may be excused for telling yourself. Distrust your distrust. Lush, opulent fields of colors, seemingly all paradisiacal, contain shades of melancholy that reveal themselves to you after your eyes adjust to their light. Mitchell absorbed the influences of Pollock, Gorky, Kline and de Kooning. There are ferocious paintings of clotted splatters in the 1950's. Then hovering shapes appear in muted green, gray and blue in the 60's. They give way by the early 70's to more vividly colored multipanel paintings in which increasing varieties of shapes and lines jostle. Mitchell, who had moved to France, denied the influence of Monet, which was undeniable. Her last works, from the 80's and early 90's, push Monet into the late 20th century, ecstatically. Hours and admission: See above. Other Mitchell shows are at Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-7727, through Aug. 16; Lennon, Weinberg, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, Suite 308, SoHo, (212) 941-0012, through Aug. 16; and Edward Tyler Nahem Fine Art, at 56 East 66th Street, (212) 517-2453, through next Friday (Kimmelman). 
 ''SCANDIA: IMPORTANT EARLY MAPS OF THE NORTHERN REGIONS AND MAPS AND CHARTS OF NORWAY FROM THE COLLECTION OF WILLIAM B. AND INGER G. GINSBERG,'' Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, near 38th Street, (212) 879-9779 (through Aug. 16). This beautiful exhibition of 76 maps, small atlases and sea charts moves from late-15th-century woodblock maps based on Ptolemy to magnificently detailed late-18th-century maps of southern Norway and concludes with a series of elegant sea charts of the Norwegian coast, crenellated with fjords. Representing some of cartography's greatest names -- including Mercator, Blaeu and Ortelius -- it traces the northward progress of map-making expertise, commerce and political autonomy. Above all, it gloriously reflects the always mobile knowledge of the unceasing wonders and challenges of the natural world. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, noon to 6 p.m. Free (Smith). 
 * ''SPLENDID ISOLATION: ART OF EASTER ISLAND,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sept. 8). The colossal stone heads that put tiny Easter Island on the map were not the only art produced by this isolated Polynesian community, as this show is out to demonstrate. The 50 or so works, from the 13th to 19th centuries, include not only one of the impassive stone heads but also smaller refined figures of carved and polished wood, painted bark cloth personages, feather headdresses, ornamental collars, clubs, dance paddles and rare inscribed tablets known as rongorongo. The business of Rapa Nui (the island's Polynesian name) carvers was to make figures giving body to the island's cosmology of gods, spirits and ancestral chiefs; the images contain their mana, or supernatural power. Among the important artifacts here are elegantly carved figures of the important god MakeMake as a mix of human and avian. He was a source of inspiration for 20th-century Surrealists. If the works don't match the intensity and expressive power of some of the African art in the Michael C. Rockefeller wing, they still give a splendid idea of a rich culture that thrived in isolation. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck). 
 Galleries: 57th Street 
 ''BLUE + WHITE = RADICAL,'' Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205 (through Aug. 9). The centuries-old tradition of blue and white porcelain lends itself to the purposes of contemporary ironists. The exhibition includes Delft-style hand grenades by Charles Krafft; plates by Paul Scott, bearing blue chain-link fence pattern over the image of a prisoner at Camp X-Ray; a surrealistic, quasi-scientific ''Semen Sampler'' by Cindy Kolodziejski; an elegant play with Chinese style in the form of a nonfunctional teapot by Leopold Foulem; and tile works by Hugo Kaagman that play with the iconography of 20th-century progress (Ken Johnson). 
 ALFONSO OSSORIO, ''HORROR VACUI''; CLIFFORD ODETS, ''PARADISE LOST,'' Michael Rosenfeld, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 247-0082 (through Aug. 9). Ossorio was a sophisticated friend of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning whose art looked like the work of a half-mad outsider. This fascinating retrospective shows him to have been a gifted draftsman and a Surrealistic assemblagist with a great feel for decorative design. Odets, the famous playwright, found relief from insomnia and writer's block by painting small pictures on paper. The charming surfaces have dark undercurrents, as in the scarily distorted head called ''Punitive Parent'' (Johnson). 
 ''SUMMER,'' James Cohan, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 755-7171 (through Sept. 1). This appealingly varied seasonal show includes an extraordinary, magically realistic head of a pink, hairless ape by Erick Swenson; red, machine-generated plastic blobs by Roxy Paine; a lightly penciled wall drawing by Sol LeWitt; finely etched prints by Inka Essenhigh and Vija Celmins; and, by Fred Tomaselli, another visually captivating exercise in pharmacological excess (Johnson). 
 Galleries: SoHo 
 JAN VERCRUYSSE, ''Camera Oscura,'' Brooke Alexander, 59 Wooster Street, (212) 925-4338 (through Aug. 31). The minor joke of Mr. Vercruysse's new series of photographs, called ''Camera Oscura,'' might take a moment to get. In each diptych, a person in costume (a girl dressed as one of ''Las Meninas,'' a man with a Duchampian bottle rack) appears standing normally on one side and doing a handstand on the other. It's a wry play on the fact that a real camera obscura creates an inverted virtual image of reality (Johnson). 
 ''WHERE IS ELVIS? THE MAN AND HIS REFLECTIONS,'' Howard Greenberg Gallery, 120 Wooster Street, (212) 334-0010 (through Aug. 16). This year is the 25th anniversary of Elvis Presley's death in 1977 at 42, a cause for this far-flung and upbeat roundup of nearly 75 photos shot at various times by different photographers. Elvis kissing Mom, Elvis in the Army, Elvis and his Cadillac, Elvis on his Harley, Elvis and his fans, Elvis and his dates, Elvis doing ''Blue Suede Shoes'' with the Dorsey brothers, Elvis's gold piano, Elvis imitators (including Jerry Seinfeld), Elvis with the blues guitarist B. B. King and a lineup of Elvis dolls all figure in these works by photographers like Norma Bergsma, David Byrne, William Eggleston, Marvin Israel and Alfred Wertheimer. Perhaps the most poignant is a 1956 action shot by Roger Marshutz taken in Tupelo, Miss., which shows the powerful communion between the icon and his fans as he straddles the microphone to belt out a song, touching their outstretched hands with his own. Take heart, Elvis seekers. As long as photography lives, old superstars will never fade away (Glueck). 
 ERNEST WITHERS, ''Memphis,'' Gallery 292, 120 Wooster Street, (212) 431-0292 (through Aug. 16). Born in 1922, Mr. Withers is not only an eminent photojournalist but was also one of the first African-American policemen in Memphis. This engaging small exhibition includes wonderful early pictures of performers like B. B. King, James Brown and Ike and Tina Turner in action at local clubs, civil rights scenes like the funeral march for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a somber picture of Jackie Robinson and fellow players (Johnson). 
 Galleries: Chelsea 
 * ''AMERICAN STANDARD: (PARA)NORMALITY AND EVERYDAY LIFE,'' Barbara Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9300 (through Aug. 16). The photographer Gregory Crewdson has gathered 22 works, in each of which something uncanny lurks beneath the banal surface of suburban existence. Photographs, paintings and sculptures by Edward Hopper, Diane Arbus, Bill Owens, Robert Gober, Vija Celmins, John Currin and others hint at how unconscious energies impinge on ordinary ego consciousness and mirror, perhaps, a society yearning for divine revelation (Johnson). 
 ''BYSTANDER,'' Andrea Rosen Gallery, 525 West 24th Street, (212) 627-5450 (through Aug. 23). John Connelly, a young New York dealer with his eyes wide open, has assembled this spicy selection of eight young photographers, some familiar, others just starting to make their marks. A seemingly unstudied, snapshot aesthetic prevails. The work breaks down into traditional genres like landscape (Christina Hejtmanek's views of the American West through rain-streaked car windows) and still life (Pete Riesett, shots of suburban dining room china cabinets). But the human figure is the center of attention for Kelly Lamb, Dean Sameshina, Ryan McGinley and Amy Steiner, who has a lovely ceiling piece. (Cotter). 
 ''EROTIKA,'' Riva, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 242-3434 (through Aug. 10). Surrealism and then Pop Art opened fine art to pornography, and now sexual explicitness is almost tiresomely ubiquitous. Still, this show has interesting moments, including the Chapman Brothers' hilariously offensive video starring two porn actresses and a mannequin's head; Kiki Seror's illuminated, digitally generated sex-chat text; Andres Serrano's portrait of a naked woman and her bovine object of desire; and a modest picture of a woman in a car by the usually over-the-top David LaChapelle (Johnson). 
 * ANDREW GRASSIE, ''Sculptures,'' Paul Morris, 465 West 23rd Street, (212) 727-2752 (through Aug. 20). Mr. Grassie paints lovely small copies of photographs of 60's-style Modernist sculptures -- classic works by Tony Smith, John Chamberlain, Donald Judd and others. Up close you discover that the apparent photographic transparency has a subtle, painterly materialism, and you can appreciate the artist's Vermeerish touch. Conceptually, the paintings are like a nerd's revenge on former campus bullies (Johnson). 
 ''GROUP SHOW,'' Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, (646) 336-7183 (through Aug. 30). This well-selected and installed exhibition includes Julian Opie's Neo-Pop landscapes, which look like children's book illustrations; Craig Kauffman's sensuous, baby blue plastic doughnut; Richard Deacon's metal sculptures, resembling flattened pillows; a large Minimalist panel of thin mirror strips by John Armleder; and the image of an inflatable flower converted into a flat, shiny stainless steel cutout by Jeff Koons (Johnson). 
 * KATHLEEN JOHNSON, ''The Smallest Wonder,'' Lucas Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3159 (through Aug. 9.) Shimmering, wavy lines of light cascade down blue, underwater swimming pool steps in Ms. Johnson's large-format, panoramic photographs. The transformation of something so ordinary to something almost mystically radiant is exhilarating (Johnson). 
 JASON ODDY; JIN MEYERSON, Frederieke Taylor Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (646) 230-0992 (through Aug. 9). Mr. Oddy, a photographic investigator, presents large color pictures shot in cryonic facilities where human bodies are deep frozen for possible future revival. His oblique images of institutional spaces and scientific equipment are less chilling than you might expect. Mr. Meyerson makes engaging, swirly semiabstract paintings in which one discovers distorted images of American football players (Johnson). 
 * ''SOMETHING, ANYTHING,'' Matthew Marks, 523 West 24th Street, (212) 243-0200 (through Aug. 16). This gallery's artist-organized summer exhibitions have all been outstanding, and this one, put together by Nayland Blake, is no exception. It's an almost-all-American extravaganza that Ping-Pongs back and forth between the sublime and the abject, and the lineup of artists is, to say the least, eclectic. It includes oddball modernists (Gaston Lachaise, Betty Parsons, H. C. Westermann), folk artists (Bill Traylor), cartoonists (Ernie Bushmiller, George Herriman), contemporary stars (Cindy Sherman, Mike Kelley) and interesting younger figures like Chris Johanson, John deFazio, Christian Marclay and Katharina Frisch. It makes all of them look like Outsider artists, doing work that is both fanatically crafted and conceptually out there beyond the fringe. Mr. Blake also contributes an installation of 3,000 record albums from his personal collection and a turntable to play them on (Cotter) 
 Last Chance 
 YOSHITAKA AMANO, Leo Koenig, 249 Centre Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 334-9255 (through tomorrow). A superstar of Japanese anime, Mr. Amano is the creator of ''Speed Racer,'' ''G-Force'' and ''Final Fantasy.'' This show features glossy, cartoon portraits of androgynous young action heroes and a near mural-size painting crammed with every ''Final Fantasy'' character. Best is a series of brush and ink paintings on paper, each representing a different emotionally excited human eye (Johnson). 
 * OLAF BREUNING, ''Hello Darkness,'' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 925-2035 (through tomorrow). Though considerably racier, the tableau that Mr. Breuning has produced here is a lot like what you see in the front yards of creative suburbanites on Halloween. After passing through a ruined library, you come upon the primal scene, illuminated by spinning and strobing colored lights: a skeleton conversing with an extraordinarily realistic sex doll lounging in a deluxe coffin. It's ludicrous but briefly gripping (Johnson). 
 CHARLA, June Kelly, 591 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 226-1660 (through today). This one-name artist begins her paintings by rubbing canvases applied to trees, rocks and other natural surfaces. In the studio, the artist develops the textures in paint, creating, at best, subtly colored abstractions of delicate and ethereal luminosity (Johnson). 
 * ''GREUZE THE DRAFTSMAN,'' Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through Sunday). Unlike Watteau, Fragonard and Boucher, Jean-Baptiste Greuze (1725-1805) does not have a name that rings bells. Yet as a dramatist in painting, he stands very high, and as a draftsman, he stands higher still. A lifelong champion of Greuze is Edgar Munhall, the chief curator emeritus of the Frick Collection, and he organized this exhibition of roughly 70 drawings to spectacular effect. They cover the gamut of Greuze's career, from his days as a student in Paris to the self-portrait that he sent to the Paris Salon the year before he died. Both the catalog and the show are majestic achievements. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $5 for students and 62+ (John Russell). 
 CARLOS MÉRIDA, Ramis Barquet, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 644-9090 (through today). Mérida, the Modernist painter, was born in Guatemala in 1891, studied in Paris and lived most of his life in Mexico City. This small retrospective follows his evolution across eight decades from a Picasso-influenced 1915 portrait of a woman to playful, mid-century grid compositions to a Cubist quartet devoted to the four seasons made three years before the artist's death at 93 (Johnson). 
 RICHARD SHARPE SHAVER, ''Weird and Wonderful Art,'' Christine Burgin, 243 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 462-2668 (through today). Less an artist than a man possessed by nutty ideas, Shaver (1907-1975) believed that images suggested by seemingly natural patterns on ordinary rocks proved the existence of titans who lived on earth before human beings. This exhibition presents a selection of Shaver's quasi-scientific rock photographs, examples of his writings and paintings teeming with blond, red-lipped figures shaded and textured so that they look as though carved from stone (Johnson)."
"388","Venus Williams Defeats Dokic in Straight Sets",1413740,"|sports",5,8,2002,"20020805T000000",NA," 
 Only one of the Williams sisters, Venus, entered the field for the Acura Classic at the La Costa Resort and Spa. Serena took the week off. 
 In today's world of women's tennis, that usually removes the only obstacle preventing the older sister from capturing yet another title. Venus Williams has lost only six times this year, three times to Serena, who has supplanted her as the top-ranked player. 
 Venus, ranked No. 2, coasted to a 6-2, 6-2 victory over sixth-seeded Jelena Dokic in 55 minutes in today's uneventful final. She was dominant, recording 23 winners to Dokic's 5. She limited her unforced errors, a former weakness, to 24. Williams had six aces and lost her serve once, but by then, the match was pretty much over. 
 ''I just had a great day,'' said Williams, who won this tournament for the third consecutive year. ''Winning is so familiar here.'' 
 She had a lot of great days this week. In Saturday night's semifinal, she dispatched Lindsay Davenport, 6-2, 6-1, in one hour. Her only real challenge came in the quarterfinals, when she needed three sets to eliminate Kim Clijsters of Belgium, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4. In that match, she crushed 31 winners, but also made 73 errors. 
 ''Fortunately, I was able to get it back,'' Williams said. 
 Cutting back on her errors has been a big priority in recent years. 
 ''You get tired of making mistakes,'' she said.''I got tired of fighting all day against myself and my opponent.'' 
 Dokic, 19, from Yugoslavia, was exhausted after two straight difficult matches, against Jennifer Capriati and Anna Kournikova. Each match went three sets. She also had a stomach virus and went to a doctor this morning. It is formidable enough facing Venus Williams even when healthy. 
 ''I was very tired from the last two days,'' Dokic said. ''I was very tired and very sore.'' 
 The fatigue was not evident early in the match. Dokic held her serve at love in the first game. After Williams took the second game, Dokic held again, saving a break point. 
 But Williams captured the next five games to take the set. Dokic held again to start the second set, but was broken in the third game. Williams cruised from there. The only miscue came when she was broken by Dokic in the sixth game. But, typically, she broke right back. 
 ''I hit two or three unbelievable drop shots and she took steps and was there and hit a winner,'' Dokic said. ''Sometimes you just have to say, 'Too good.' '' 
 Nonetheless, Dokic, the world's fifth-ranked player, is not ready to surrender to the Williams sisters. 
 ''They are beatable at times,'' Dokic said. ''Not a lot of times, but they are beatable. How long they can keep it going is a different story.'' 
 In the meantime, though, a more immediate question is: Can the older sister regain the upper hand? Venus's last two losses to Serena, both in straight sets, came in the finals at the French Open and Wimbledon. Serena had also beaten her earlier in the year at a tournament in Miami. Their next meeting could be at the United States Open, which begins in late August. Venus is the two-time defending champion. 
 This week, the roles will be reversed. 
 Venus Williams will fly back to her home in Florida while Serena will compete in the JPMorgan Chase Open at Manhattan Beach, Calif. Also in the field will be Capriati, Davenport, Dokic and Clijsters.

 WEDDINGS/CELEBRATIONS"
"391","Before WorldCom, the Funeral Industry Set the Standard for Venality",1420681,"|opinion",3,9,2002,"20020903T000000",NA," 
 The high point -- make that the low point -- of ''The American Way of Death'' is Jessica Mitford's account of a friend's attempt to bury a relative without spending a fortune. When the friend asked for an inexpensive redwood coffin, the funeral home agreed at first. But the salesman called back to say the deceased was too tall, and she had to buy a coffin that cost $100 more. When Ms. Mitford's friend balked, the salesman responded, ''Oh, all right, we'll use the redwood one, but we'll have to cut off his feet.'' 
 This summer it feels as if big business is letting us down as never before. But corporate scandals have been a part of American history since the Yazoo land fraud of 1795. Thirty-nine years ago Ms. Mitford exposed one of the most jaw-dropping of all: the great funeral industry scandal of 1963. Her findings, acerbically set forth in her surprise best seller, hold some important lessons for today's reformers. 
 This unlikely scandal was set off by an unlikely crusader. One of six daughters of the Baron of Redesdale, Ms. Mitford left the British aristocracy behind and married Bob Treuhaft, an Oakland trade-union lawyer. From him she learned that when working men died, their hard-won death benefits -- intended to support their widows and children -- invariably ended up in the pockets of unscrupulous undertakers. 
 On the trail of injustice, Ms. Mitford made undercover visits to funeral parlors and pored over back issues of Casket & Sunnyside -- and the rest is muckraking history. ''The American Way of Death'' soared to the top of the New York Times best-seller list, and ignited a firestorm. CBS turned it into an hourlong documentary, and newspapers from New York to San Francisco investigated local funeral practices. Ms. Mitford's encounters with shady undertakers and cemetery plot salesmen led her to some conclusions that apply to today's corporate scandals, or most likely soon will: 
 1. Never underestimate corporate greed. Before her book came out, funeral directors presented themselves as humble comforters of the bereaved. But Ms. Mitford showed that they charged more to bury 1.7 million Americans a year than universities charged to educate 3.6 million. 
 Many observers of today's scandals have been shocked by how far rich people will go to become richer. Bernard Ebbers, who took in more than $46 million at WorldCom, still grabbed nearly a million shares of hot I.P.O. stock, possibly illegally. Martha Stewart, who is worth a good fraction of a billion dollars, took the time to personally trade -- perhaps using insider information -- a few thousand shares of ImClone stock. Having met prosperous businessmen who would threaten to cut off a loved one's feet to make a few more bucks, Ms. Mitford would not have been a bit surprised. 
 2. Corporate crooks often tell us exactly what they're doing. Much of ''The American Way of Death'' is simply excerpts from the funeral industry's own publications. (The book ''Successful Funeral Management'' warned undertakers not to line up coffins by price, since it made it too easy for the grieving family to comparison shop.) So it is with the current scandal, where the most damning evidence is in many cases the wrongdoers' own words. Wall Street analysts issued ''buy'' recommendations while yukking it up in internal e-mails that the stocks were junk. C.E.O.'s made bullish pronouncements, duping their shareholders and employees, while filling out forms to sell their own stock. When their words are quoted back to them in legal indictments, it will be akin to what Ms. Mitford retorted to funeral directors who complained about her book: She could not see why they were unhappy, since it was ''almost entirely given over to expounding their point of view.'' 
 3. Sometimes it isn't just the bad apples. President Bush has tried to argue that the misdeeds of Enron, WorldCom and the rest are ethical lapses of a few bad actors, and that the solution is criminal prosecutions. But the point of ''The American Way of Death'' is that the funeral industry as a whole was corrupt. ''This would normally be the place to say . . . 'I am not, of course, speaking of the vast majority of ethical undertakers,' '' Ms. Mitford wrote in the foreword. ''But the vast majority of ethical undertakers is precisely the subject of this book.'' The only solution, she insisted -- as reformers today must -- was sweeping reform. 
 4. Reform comes slowly. For those hoping for meaningful reform now, the funeral experience is sobering. When ''The American Way of Death'' came out in 1963, the public was outraged. But despite a flood of angry letters, it took the Federal Trade Commission until 1972 to begin an investigation. It was 12 more years before it adopted -- over strenuous industry lobbying -- a rule instituting some of the reforms Ms. Mitford had recommended. 
 The new rule required funeral homes, but not cemeteries, to itemize services and costs in advance so consumers could decide which they wanted. Still, when Ms. Mitford died in 1996, much of her agenda had been blocked. The Senate held hearings this summer on a bill, to be introduced later this month, that would, among other things, require cemeteries to itemize costs -- just in time for the 40th anniversary of Ms. Mitford's explosive little book.

"392","In a Stricken Big City, a Small Town Sees Itself",1422636,NA,11,9,2002,"20020911T000000","|New York City|Wabash (Ind)|Indiana"," 
 NEW YORK has a way of making small-town people feel small. For those who grow up here in northern Indiana, where towns like Wabash seem stranded in a limitless sea of corn, the city can be overwhelming. 
 Emily France, a piano teacher and former cheerleader at Wabash High, remembers that during her one trip to New York she kept looking at people who stared right through her. The longer she stayed, she said, the smaller she felt. 
 ''New York was just this huge dream of a place,'' Mrs. France said. ''You really couldn't touch it, even if you went there.'' 
 Then, on a crisp September morning, hijacked airplanes smashed into the two tallest buildings in the untouchable city. As the towers collapsed, so did the perceived distance between big town and small. 
 That day, New York seemed terrifyingly close to rural Indiana. At Riverview Elementary in Marion, a town south of Wabash, a second grader named Katlyn Sirk asked to be excused. ''I want to go to the moon,'' Katlyn told her teacher. ''I think I could be safe on the moon. I don't feel safe here anymore.'' 
 In the days and weeks that followed, fear ebbed away. Taking its place was empathy, as people in Wabash and Marion and across America began seeing New Yorkers as neither faraway, nor intimidating, nor all that different from themselves. A New York Times poll in late September of last year found that 84 percent of Americans had a good image of the city. That compared with 61 percent in 1998 and 40 percent in 1996. 
 ''I have come to think of New York as a nice neighborhood just outside of Wabash,'' said Mrs. France, 27. 
 The piano teacher, who breast-fed her daughter, Isabel, last fall while watching and weeping over television images of the wounded city, said she still saw tormented faces in her mind's eye. They belong to women whose husbands and brothers disappeared. For several days after the attack, these women appeared on network TV morning programs, holding up photos of missing loved ones and pleading for help in finding them. 
 ''They could just as easily have been from Wabash,'' she said. ''When I think now of what makes New York strong, I think of its people, not its buildings. New York seems like a hometown. I could go there and stop and talk to somebody.'' 
 In the small towns of northern Indiana, crime is low, church attendance is high and many high school graduates attend local Christian colleges. People here remember what the Rev. Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson had to say last fall about why New York was made the target of the attack: that God was angry at the city's abortionists, feminists and gays. 
 When asked about the views of Mr. Falwell and Mr. Robertson, Jack Brady, a chaplain at Indiana Wesleyan University in Marion, shook his head. Since last September, Mr. Brady has made three trips to New York, where he has helped counsel firefighters, police officers and construction workers traumatized by the search for body parts at ground zero. 
 On his trips, Mr. Brady worked the night shift at the recovery site. Some nights, he handed out letters of encouragement written by elementary school children from Marion. Other nights, he distributed cheesecake and chocolates bought with money raised by students at nearby Huntington North High School. 
 As in many parts of the country, New York City firefighters are celebrities here. Mr. Brady invited three New York firefighters to Marion to give speeches. They received standing ovations. 
 ''After this year, I can say that we just feel closer to New York,'' Mr. Brady said. ''We feel sorry, we feel loyalty and we feel a lot of racial, geographical and political walls have come down.'' 
 BESIDES being sympathetic, people around this part of Indiana have become more curious about New York. At the Wabash Carnegie Public Library, the women who dominate the book discussion group agreed that their spring topic would be ''New York Reflections.'' 
 ''The city is a place that they normally wouldn't go,'' said Katherine Tinsley, a professor of American history at Manchester College nearby, who led the book group. 
 Before Sept. 11, more than a few people in Wabash believed the city to be infested with crime and tormented by traffic. New Yorkers were often thought of as fast-talking, aggressive and rude. 
 ''The attitude here was one of uneasiness with big-city people,'' Professor Tinsley said. ''People would assume they did not have the same values or interests. But 9/11 changed all that.'' 
 What seemed to impress book group members from Wabash was how New Yorkers, after the attacks, pulled together. ''This is what people here see as a small-town virtue,'' she said. 
 Richard Edwin Ford, whose family owns Ford Meter Box Company, based in Wabash and one of the world's largest manufacturers of water meters, agreed that in the last year many people in town had overcome a lifetime's worth of wariness about the city. Still, he says, there are limits. 
 ''We out in the Midwest now think of New York City as a collection of humans, far more than we ever did before,'' Mr. Ford said. ''We still wonder, though, why in the world would they want to live there?''

 A triple layer of air defenses has been laid over the nation's capital in advance of the Sept. 11 anniversary, with high-altitude radar planes scanning the skies, high-performance jet fighters flying 24-hour patrols and surface-to-air missiles being loaded into launchers late tonight. 
 On orders of Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, the Avenger missile system was loaded with heat-seeking Stinger missiles, which are designed to defend against low-altitude airplanes even if they are traveling at high speeds. The system, which includes eight Stingers in two reloadable pods, is carried atop a Humvee troop transport vehicle. 
 The Stinger can also defend against helicopters, but not other missiles. Some handheld Stingers were also readied for use. 
 Though small numbers of surface-to-air missiles have been posted at certain government buildings over the years, military officials said this was the first deployment of surface-to-air missiles widely across the Washington region since 1961, during the Cuban missile crisis. 
 Air Force F-16's have been deployed in 24-hour patrols over Washington and New York since Friday. Other attack jets and support aircraft across the country remain available on ''strip alert,'' which means they can be airborne at short notice. 
 The nation's premier airborne surveillance and command jet, the E3 Awacs, is also on 24-hour patrol over Washington. The distinctive black-and-white, mushroom-shaped radar dome atop the modified Boeing 707 has a range of 250 miles and can monitor movement from the surface of the earth up to the stratosphere, officials say.

"395","Fears of a Hard Landing Rattle Tokyo",1430577,"|business",10,10,2002,"20021010T000000","|Japan|Japan"," 
 As Tokyo markets veered down yet again today, investors bailed out, tightened their safety belts or begged the government to avoid the dreaded ''hard landing'' of bankruptcies and unemployment. 
 But Heizo Takenaka, the new economics minister, merely confirmed what investors already knew: Japanese markets are in severe shape. And Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi rebuffed politicians' pleas by refusing to try to make a soft landing with a cushion of several trillion more yen in bonds. 
 Foreigners were net sellers for the 13th consecutive day, helping to push the Nikkei index down almost 2 percent, to 8,539.34, a new 19-year low. Last month, according to data compiled by Reuters, foreign investors sold a net $11.3 billion worth of Japanese stocks, the largest monthly net selling since the Ministry of Finance started tracking the capital flow statistics four years ago. 
 Investors fear that the market will continue losing altitude until the government announces a macroeconomic package, expected next week. The package is an attempt to ease the social pain of banks' calling in billions of dollars in bad loans as well as an effort to prevent a few major bankruptcies from dragging the economy into a severe recession. 
 ''If a 'hard landing' means a crash, nobody wants it, but we share a recognition that time is running out,'' said Yutaka Kosai, chairman of the Japan Center for Economic Research and head of a new task force that is meeting this week to devise a strategy to deal with nearly half a trillion dollars in bad loans. 
 Businesspeople fear that bankers, by calling in bad loans, will set off a vicious circle of more bankruptcies, more unemployment and less consumer demand. 
 Today, in an effort to calm the markets, Japan's finance minister, Masajuro Shiokawa, blamed the media. ''Japanese media were running stories as if big companies were going bankrupt and Japan is going into a big panic,'' the 80-year-old minister told reporters. ''Because of these reports, stock prices have failed to reflect the real strength of companies. I think this is very annoying, and, as a politician, I am really cross with this.'' 
 But one alarmed Japanese is from the core of the business establishment: Hiroshi Okuda, chairman of the Japan Business Federation. 
 ''I am watching with a deep sense of crisis,'' said Mr. Okuda, who is also chairman of Toyota Motor, Japan's largest company. Looking ahead to weak half-year earnings reports expected in the coming weeks, he said Monday, ''It is said that the economy has hit bottom, but judging from the reality, there are still many bad indicators around, and corporate confidence remains weak.'' 
 Japanese banks are heavily invested in corporate stocks, and the falling stock markets are battering their capital. In the last seven days of trading, latent losses on shares held by the nation's 12 largest commercial banks have jumped by 46 percent, to $41 billion, according to an estimate prepared today by the Daiwa Institute of Research. 
 With the Nikkei index briefly dipping below 8,500 today, the capital-to-asset ratios of these banks are around 9 percent, just above the 8 percent level required for banks to operate internationally. If the Nikkei falls below 8,000, the ratios of many banks may fall below 8 percent, the institute calculates. 
 Today, Hidenao Miyajima, an investment strategist here for Commerzbank Securities, predicted that American bottom fishers would soon appear here. He said that ''a round of bargain hunting in Japan by these U.S. investors is quite possible.'' 
 But contrarians were hard to find as selling continued to dominate. 
 On Monday, Tokyo markets fell nearly 4 percent on reports that Mr. Takenaka said no bank or company in Japan was ''too big to fail.'' 
 On Tuesday, he helped to stabilize the market by adopting a lower profile, canceling a series of interviews with the foreign financial media. 
 ''Japan has strong economic potential,'' he told a news conference for Japanese reporters. ''Share prices will be bolstered substantially if we carry out our existing policy.'' 
 According to Paul Sheard, chief Asia economist for Lehman Brothers, ''The backtracking was damage control, not a major shift in policy.'' 
 With politicians of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party said to be trying to curb Mr. Takenaka's power and block his clean-up campaign, foreigners worry that his zeal for reform will be neutralized by a hostile Parliament and bureaucracy. 
 ''Having proceeded with marginal changes, something more dramatic is in order,'' Kenneth Rogoff, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, said on a visit here today. ''There are risks to restructuring, but there are also risks to continuing to muddle through.'' 
 To reassure depositors, the government announced Monday that it was reversing a policy and extending for two years blanket insurance on bank deposits. Behind this decision was a clear fear of a run on banks in coming months. 
 With Japan bracing for an upsurge in unemployment, some government ministers have called for a special bond issue, or supplementary budget, to pay for benefits and retraining for the jobless. Benefits were strained last year by 20,052 corporate bankruptcies, the second-highest total since World War II. 
 But with the Japanese government the most heavily indebted of any major developed nation, government officials today discouraged talk of a ''supplementary budget.'' 
 ''We are not thinking at all about increasing bond issuances,'' Yasuo Fukuda, the chief cabinet secretary, said."
"396","It Must Be Picture Day",1431448,"|education|new york|region",13,10,2002,"20021013T000000","|Bedford Hills (NY)"," 
 WENDY CROWELL knelt in front of a small girl with a nimbus of ringlets, gently combed stray tendrils into place, and guided her back into the line of other well-scrubbed, dressed-up children here at the Bedford Hills Elementary School. 
 With the girls attired in dresses or matching skirt and sweater-sets and shiny black patent Mary Jane shoes, and many of the boys wearing unfamiliar jackets and ties, it was clearly Picture Day. 
 The photographers from Lifetouch -- part camp counselor, part psychologist, and part child wrangler in their efforts to cajole a smile from a shy child, or contain an overly exuberant one -- shepherded each child through a sitting for an individual portrait and the group class photo. P.T.A. parents like Mrs. Crowell, chairwoman of the school's picture committee, moved through the lines of waiting children, fixing hair with disposable combs and adjusting clothing. 
 School pictures, which mark a child's time line as much as the pencil marks scratched to mark his or her height on the kitchen wall, are big business. National companies like the Minneapolis-based Lifetouch are seeking market share from local, family-owned companies like Davis Studio in Mamaroneck, Images School Photography in New Rochelle, or Irvin Simon in Elmont, Queens, which, like Davis, also has an extensive regional business. Other national photography companies include Herff Jones Photography Division of Lewiston, Minn., and Inter-State Studio of Sedalia, Mo. 
 Steve Miller, president of Irvin Simon Photographers, a 56-year-old business founded by his grandfather, said, ''We're big enough to be competitive and nimble enough to care.'' 
 A smaller business like Images School Photography, however, finds that ''it is hard to compete with the national companies,'' said Joan McGrath, owner of the company, who mostly works with the schools and athletic leagues of New Rochelle. 
 Since pricing isn't the main source of competition, those who select the photo studios cite other reasons for choosing a national company over a local one. ''They're easier to work with,'' Mrs. Crowell said. ''They seem to keep the children under good control.'' 
 School pictures embrace the entire spectrum of the school experience, from nursery school to high school proms, along with athletic teams, band programs and dance studio recitals. The photos are offered in more sizes and shapes now, too. In recent years, as more elementary and middle schools have produced school yearbooks, previously the domain of high schools, the school-photo studios have provided images for use in those publications. Many companies also provide CD-Rom's, bar coded photos for school identification cards and other services to the schools. There are items like photo key chains and refrigerator magnet frames, bookmarks and Christmas ornaments, even giant posters of an entire group. 
 The increased use of digital photography permits more personalization and customized service, with companies like Lifetouch able to offer class photos with each child's name printed on them. 
 Although the peak of the school pictures business traditionally takes place between September and December, with the expansion into other kinds of photo opportunities, many photo companies are now busy year round. 
 Given the heightened awareness of any business that comes in contact with children, these companies conduct criminal background checks on their photographers. Lifetouch's photographers, who are full-time employees, not freelancers, undergo training sessions on how photographers should work with the students. 
 The school picture market, for grades kindergarten through 12, is about $1.5 billion a year, according to Tom Crawford, director of corporate communications at the Professional School Photographer's Association, which is part of Photo Marketing Association International, the trade group based in Jackson, Mich. According to a recent survey by the Photo Marketing Association International, the average school picture package purchase last year was $29 (the average for high school senior photos was $256). 
 With school picture packages starting about $20 -- most purchases are $20 to $25 -- and going up to about $60 for the full treatment -- photos enough for two sets of grandparents and the extended family -- the market is lucrative. Even an uncertain economy doesn't appear to have much impact. As Steve Smith, the Newburgh-based Lifetouch representative for Westchester, Rockland, Putnam and Orange Counties who works with 65 schools in Westchester, said, ''Everybody loves their children.'' 
 School pictures, which are generally arranged by P.T.A., committees, are also fund-raisers. Depending on the size of the school and the participation rate, school pictures can generate anywhere from $1,000 to close to $10,000 for a school. The price of the picture packages usually reflects the 20 to 25 percent that the photo companies return to the P.T.A.'s as a fund-raiser. 
 While elementary and middle schools usually have a better than 90 percent participation rate by families buying picture packages, not surprisingly, the percentage slacks off by high school to about 50 percent. It picks up again for senior year formal portraits and prom pictures. 
 To help parents whose budgets are already stretched, the Thomas Edison Elementary School in Port Chester recently developed a sibling picture program. If a family's children are all students at the elementary school, parents can opt to have their children photographed together. 
 For the schools, picture day is a worthwhile event, despite the distractions and interruptions. ''I set up a schedule, but parents are in charge,'' said Maureen Zygmont, the principal of the Bedford Hills Elementary School. ''We combine picture day with dress-up day, and the children come out of class for a very short period of time, and go right back to class, so it's not a big deal.'' 
 Even among ''too cool for school'' teenagers, the disdain with which many high school students view school pictures may be only a pose. 
 ''This shows how many years you've been in the school,'' said Bhumica Patel, a 16-year-old junior at Alexander Hamilton High School in Elmsford. ''It's important. You want to look good, and see how different you turned out from when you started.''

"397","BEIJING RELEASES LEADING DISSIDENT",1451451,"|world|front page|washington",25,12,2002,"20021225T000000","|China|China"," 
 China released its most prominent pro-democracy prisoner today, sending him to exile and medical treatment in the United States. 
 The Christmas-eve release of Xu Wenli, 59, who spent more than 16 of the last 21 years in prison for his irrepressible advocacy of civil liberties, came one week after a visiting American diplomat made pleas on his behalf. The release signaled China's strong desire for good relations with the United States. 
 Since late 1998, when Mr. Xu received a 13-year prison sentence on charges of subversion after he helped organize an independent political party, American officials and human rights groups abroad have repeatedly sought his release. The appeals grew more urgent after 1999, when doctors discovered that Mr. Xu suffers from chronic and progressive infection with hepatitis B. 
 While other prominent dissidents have been released over the years on what often appeared to be trumped-up medical grounds, Mr. Xu's liver disease is serious and worsening, family members said. Officially, he was granted medical parole today so he can seek advanced treatments for the viral disease in the United States, said John Kamm, the leader of an American human-rights foundation who said he was authorized by the Chinese to announce the release. 
 ''This was directly related to the Chinese government's desire to improve relations with the United States,'' said Mr. Kamm, executive director of the Dui Hua Foundation in San Francisco, which monitors Chinese political and religious prisoners. In Washington, the State Department spokesman, Philip Reeker, said the United States was ''pleased that China has released Xu Wenli on medical parole.'' Mr. Reeker said the case of Mr. Xu had been pressed by the United States, other countries, various private groups and members of Congress. 
 This evening, with no publicity here, Mr. Xu and his wife, He Xintong, boarded a plane for Chicago, where their daughter, who teaches at a high school in Rhode Island, planned to meet them and accompany them to New York City. 
 [The couple arrived Tuesday evening at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, where Mr. Xu was reunited with his daughter, Xu Jin. He declined interviews and just offered ''a big thank you,'' said Mickey Spiegel, a friend of the daughter, The Associated Press reported.] 
 Last week, during a meeting here, Lorne Craner, the assistant secretary of state for human rights, had placed Mr. Xu at the top of a list of political prisoners whose release the United States considered a priority. Afterward, Mr. Craner said in Beijing that the Chinese had promised to issue unconditional invitations to United Nations rights monitors exploring issues related to torture and religious freedom. 
 While welcoming Mr. Xu's freedom, rights advocates abroad noted that dozens of others who pushed for a new political party in 1998 remain imprisoned and that overall, thousands of people are in jail for peaceful expressions of dissent or efforts to organize. Among them are Qin Yongmin, 49, who was a close associate of Mr. Xu and who was sentenced to 12 years in prison in December 1998, and Wang Youcai, 36, who was the main founder that year of the ill-fated China Democracy Party. He was sentenced to 11 years. 
 American officials have also sought the release of Rebiya Kadeer, a prominent Uighur Muslim businesswoman who is imprisoned on weakly substantiated charges of fomenting an independence movement in Xinjiang province. 
 Mr. Xu, who was born in 1943, described himself as an idealistic Marxist during the 1960's. In the revolutionary spirit of that era, he decided to get his education in society rather than at a university. 
 He spent time in the Chinese Navy, then was an electrician with the Beijing railroads. But in the late 1970's he emerged as a leader of the ''democracy wall'' movement, a brief outpouring of calls for political rights that was soon dealt with harshly. 
 Mr. Xu spent 12 years in prison, with long stretches in solitary confinement, before his release in 1993. 
 Mr. Xu could be a prickly figure and he publicly feuded with another democracy wall activist, Wei Jingsheng, who was sent into exile in the United States in 1997 after spending much of his adult life in prison. 
 But Mr. Xu's single-minded devotion to democratic principles never flagged, and he was known for his steely analyses of what he saw as the Communist government's half-measures and frequent flouting of its own Constitution. 
 In 1998, during what appeared to be a political softening around the time of a friendly visit to China by President Bill Clinton, Mr. Xu and Mr. Qin together made open calls for free labor unions and independent political parties. In the face of intense surveillance and repeated brief detentions, they tried to set up a domestic human-rights monitoring network using e-mail and faxes. 
 Then, as the fledgling China Democracy Party attracted followers and attention, the two joined forces with Mr. Wang -- a younger rights advocate who had cut his teeth in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. 
 Late in 1998, the party was formally banned and the police rounded up scores of its followers around the country. The quick, harsh sentences dealt to Mr. Xu, Mr. Qin and Mr. Wang brought angry words from the United States and other Western governments. 
 When he received his 13-year sentence after a three-and-a-half hour secret trial in December 1998, Mr. Xu was allowed a half hour with his wife. 
 ''He told me he'd be able to handle the pain,'' Ms. He said in an interview at the time. ''He said that this would give him time to think things over and calmly reflect on what has happened.'' 
 Earlier, Mr. Xu had rejected proposals to go into exile. But his worsening medical condition as well as his lengthy new sentence apparently led him to change his mind."
"398","No Second Acts in Punk? Says Who?",1452300,"|week in review",29,12,2002,"20021229T000000","|Great Britain"," 
 AFTER the news came last week that Joe Strummer of the first-wave British punk band the Clash had died of a heart attack at the age of 50, some people probably thought, ''He was still around?'' But a few others, those who still read the pop music press and listen to minority-niche music, knew it meant more than the passing of an icon from their youth. 
 A 25-year-old today wasn't even conceived the night the Sex Pistols, the best-known of the punk Class of '76, broke up. But most young people know what punk rock is. Thanks to the Ramones, the Sex Pistols and the Clash, punk rock established itself as a template for youth rebellion, and countless bands have followed in their footsteps, sometimes so closely that the concept of creativity doesn't enter the picture. 
 The British milieu that the Clash emerged from called out for punk. When the Sex Pistols' Johnny Rotten, draped on his microphone, intoned, ''No future,'' it was the cry of youth coming out of school to discover that there were no jobs in Margaret Thatcher's Britain and refusing to accept that as reality. Punk, in its most narrowly defined form, was a kid banging his head on a wall labeled NO. It had its own fashion, its own art and its own music. 
 It was a bohemia in the classic sense, a neutral ground where rebels from all social classes become equal by rejecting the values around them. It is also a transition, as Jerrold Seigel asserts in his 1986 book ''Bohemian Paris.'' There comes a time when most participants in any bohemian movement either put on a suit and get a job in a bank or declare themselves professionals at painting, dance, literature or whatever. Put another way, you can only bang your head on the wall of NO for so long before you either get a blinding headache or the wall crumbles and the room on the other side is labeled YES. 
 That room, though, is only available to the most talented and dedicated. It takes a lot of work to get to it and even more to stay there. For the punks, the equivalent of the day job at the bank was mooching around the record business; two of the original four Sex Pistols are session players today. The other, John Lydon (Johnny Rotten), puts out the occasional album and continues to be a media provocateur. Sid Vicious is famously dead. Others from the original London punk cohort of the Clash have become social workers, civil servants, artists. The former Clash bassist Paul Simenon is a successful painter. 
 And Joe Strummer? He stayed Joe Strummer. He had come to the Clash with a full knowledge of American rockabilly and soul music, and shared with the others a love of reggae. Unlike many of their contemporaries, the Clash were overtly political, and attracted black bohemians like the filmmaker Don Letts and DJ Mikey Dread into their circle. 
 Once they had the power to do so, they had their heroes open their shows: Bo Diddley in the United States, and in Britain Joe Ely, the not-quite-rock-not-quite-country songwriter from Texas. These were their roots. 
 The Clash's breakup in the mid-1980's was Mr. Strummer's graduation. He got roles in films like Jim Jarmusch's ''Mystery Train''; the director Alex Cox used him as both an actor and a soundtrack composer. But Mr. Strummer must have longed for that fusion of styles the Clash tried but never really achieved, because after many years he put together another band, the Mescaleros, all musical polymaths. It is difficult for such an unclassifiable band to succeed these days, but not impossible. Mr. Strummer quite likely knew he had a long haul in front of him, but it's just as likely that he didn't mind. 
 The nostalgics are now denied the possibility of a Clash reunion when the band is inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame next spring. But fans are also denied Mr. Strummer's vision of many kinds of music bringing people together. 
 So which one of you punks is going to pick up the torch, huh? 
 Ed Ward is the rock historian for NPR's ''Fresh Air'' and is based in Berlin. 
 Correction:  January 5, 2003, Sunday  An article last Sunday about the legacy of the Clash and other punk rock bands in the 1970's referred incorrectly to the social climate from which the Sex Pistols emerged. It was not the Britain of Margaret Thatcher: she became prime minister in 1979, and the Sex Pistols disbanded in 1978. 
 A picture with the article was published in error. It showed Mick Jones of the Clash -- not Joe Strummer, who died earlier in the week."

 PaceWildenstein  32 East 57th Street, Manhattan  Through March 29 
 Steeped in a brew of ancient Catalan and avant-garde European art, particularly Surrealism, the Spanish artist Antoni Tàpies's paintings have retained their emblematic power over the years. But their arcane symbols, thickly encrusted surfaces and sober colors, sometimes vivified by blood-red, now seem less provocative than evocative of past work. 
 Conditioned in his youth by the somber spectacle of the Spanish Civil War, the artist takes a less-than-rosy view of the human condition, and his imagery sometimes suggests body parts and bandages in hardscrabble contexts. In ''Perforated Hands,'' one of the grimmer and more realistic of these paintings on wood, we look down on a headless body in thickly encrusted paint. The neck where the head once sat is covered by a bandage; the hands, which seem to be playing a form of cat's cradle, are punctured by stigmata like those of Christ. This allegory of suffering rests on a dark ground, in which glimmer two painted moundlike humps. 
 But most of his paintings tell less. They are rife with Christian symbols or emblems of more ancient beliefs, along with arrows, holes, gouges and small piles of inscrutable substances. A very large canvas called ''Your Face'' is a desert of sand-colored canvas and bandagelike pieces, strung together by wire and marked on one side by three black X's, on the other by a crescent. 
 Mr. Tàpies sometimes -- not always convincingly -- attaches battered objects to his surfaces, the better to bring his work more in line with material reality, like the wooden slats and rolls of paper and canvas in ''Broken Pallet.'' Still, the strength of this work lies in the tension between earthy and spiritual, the ''real'' and the symbolic, even if the artist's ability to bring it off sometimes wavers.

 There are more ways than one to view ''Hukkle,'' the luminous directorial debut of Gyorgi Palfi, a Hungarian filmmaker whose intensified, child's-eye apprehension of the natural world might be described as psychedelic. If you're attracted to pure, exquisitely photographed cinematic depictions of the world, you could almost lie down in ''Hukkle'' as if it were a meadow and soak in its sun-drenched atmosphere. 
 The film has hardly any spoken words, and except for a scene of a church chorus, the sounds humans make are treated as another manifestation of environmental noise on a teeming soundtrack. That soundtrack is a kind of pastoral symphony that lends the hum of the rural outdoors (with indoor sidetracks to a country kitchen and a sewing factory) a layered richness that seems three-dimensional. 
 But as the movie builds up its bucolic vision, it also teases you with enigmatic clues to an actual murder in the rural Hungarian village where it takes place. You don't have to piece together these clues to be satisfied with the film, which New Directors/New Films is showing today and tomorrow. It works just fine as a sophisticated wildlife documentary with a submerged narrative. But if you enjoy the challenge of solving difficult mysteries, ''Hukkle'' presents a tantalizing case waiting to be cracked. 
 The film's central figure is an old man who emerges from his shack by the side of a road and sits on a bench observing the rural traffic. This wizened sentinel, to whom the movie returns again and again, remains silent except for a prolonged case of the hiccups, whose sounds (the movie's title is a pun on ''hiccup'') supply witty, deflating punctuation. 
 ''Hukkle'' portrays this solitary figure, as well the other people in the film, as creatures who are not much different from the insects, fish, farm animals and domestic pets surrounding them. The director's vision has much in common with the dour cinematic portraits of Gallic small-town life drawn by the French director Bruno Dumont, but he carries the same surreal impulse much further. By paying as close attention to the activities of bees, ants, cats and moles (photographed in extreme close-up) as he pays to humans, he insinuates a radically skewed vision of the food chain in which all species are interconnected and equal in life and death. 
 One theme of the film is the agricultural process that puts food on people's tables. Sequences observe grain being harvested and turned into flour, beekeeping and the gathering of honey. A frog is swallowed by a fish, which in turn is caught by a fisherman. These commonplace activities wouldn't be worth recording if they weren't enthrallingly photographed (by Gergely Poharnok) with an eye that marvels at the vibrancy of matter itself. 
 As the film goes along, its tone darkens. A kitten frolicking in a field suddenly keels over dead, perhaps from accidental poisoning. A honeybee held between two fingers is crushed to death. 
 By the end of ''Hukkle,'' the images of violence and predation have erased the mood of benignity, and the rumbling bass notes of this pastoral symphony evoke a sustained moan of despair. 
 HUKKLE  Written (in Hungarian, with English subtitles) and directed by Gyorgy Palfi; director of photography, Gergely Poharnok; edited by Gabor Marinkas; music by Balazs Barna and Samu Gryllus; produced by Csava Bereczki and Andras Bohm; released by Shadow Distribution.

"404","Rebuking His Critics, Head of Israeli Labor Party Steps Down",1486442,"|world|washington",5,5,2003,"20030505T000000","|Israel|Israel"," 
 Lashing out at rivals within his own faction, Amram Mitzna quit today as the leader of Israel's left-of-center Labor Party -- a sign of the disarray hobbling Israel's left as the Bush administration presses a new Middle East peace plan. 
 The resignation may eventually open the way for Labor to join the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, but seems unlikely to affect the new peace process immediately. 
 Led by Mr. Mitzna, who became chairman of the party only last November, Labor was crushed by Mr. Sharon's Likud Party in elections in January. 
 Since then, riven by personal rivalries and lacking a coherent message, Labor, once Israel's dominant party and now the leader of the opposition, has not exerted much influence on Mr. Sharon's right-wing government to embrace the peace initiative, known as the road map. 
 The new peace plan calls for simultaneous concessions by Israel and the Palestinians. Mr. Sharon says he accepts the plan, but is seeking substantive changes. He insists that the Palestinians must dismantle terrorist groups before Israel eases its military actions or restrictions on Palestinians, or takes mandated steps to freeze settlement growth and remove settlement outposts built in the past two years. 
 Assistant Secretary of State William J. Burns met today with the Israeli foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, and other officials to try to advance the peace plan, which was developed by the Bush administration, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia. 
 Mr. Burns said that President Bush and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell had in mind steps that Israel could ''consider in its own self-interest to reinforce important steps on the Palestinian side to act decisively against terror and violence.'' 
 He specifically cited aid and relief needs. ''Obviously, the humanitarian situation for Palestinians is a very difficult one, and we very much hope that concrete steps can be taken to ease that,'' he said. Mr. Powell is expected to arrive within a week to meet separately with Mr. Sharon and the new Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas. 
 Meeting today with his cabinet ministers, Mr. Sharon repeated his demand that the Palestinians wage war against terrorist groups, not merely reach a cease-fire with them. 
 Mr. Abbas has urged Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other terrorist groups to give up their weapons and join the Palestinian political process. Meeting with Palestinian reporters in Ramallah today, Mr. Abbas repeated his policy that only the governing Palestinian Authority should control weapons and decide policy toward Israel. 
 In a clash today in Nablus, in the West Bank, a 14-year-old Palestinian boy was shot dead. Palestinians in Nablus said he was throwing stones in the Balata refugee camp when Israeli troops shot him in the head. The Israeli Army said soldiers conducting an incursion were met by rioters and opened fire twice, once at a Palestinian who climbed onto an armored vehicle and once at a Palestinian who threw a firebomb. 
 Mr. Abbas and Mr. Sharon have said they would like to meet promptly. Mr. Sharon has refused to meet Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and American officials have followed that policy since June. 
 After taking over the leadership of Labor in November, Mr. Mitzna, 58, called for immediate negotiations with whomever the Palestinians put forward as leaders, to be followed by a unilateral Israeli separation from the Palestinian population in the West Bank and Gaza if talks failed within a year. Mr. Mitzna urged immediate withdrawal of soldiers and settlers from the Gaza Strip. 
 His positions were popular, but his campaign was widely viewed as inept. Mr. Mitzna, the mayor of Haifa and a former general, was not well known nationally, and failed to convince Israelis that he could be trusted with their security. Labor's participation in Mr. Sharon's government, in which it held both the defense and foreign affairs portfolios, also undercut its ability to present itself as a stark alternative. 
 At a news conference this evening, Mr. Mitzna predicted that Israelis would ultimately adopt Labor's land-for-peace proposals, saying that the nation must end settlements and ''separate from the Palestinians and from so many illusions.'' But in the elections, Labor fell to 19 seats from 25 in the 120-seat Parliament, while the Likud party doubled its presence, to 38 seats from its previous 19. 
 Mr. Mitzna rebuffed Mr. Sharon's invitation to join a new coalition government, saying he believed that Mr. Sharon would not make concessions like closing settlements. Other Labor leaders have been eager to join, and some have undermined Mr. Mitzna. 
 At the news conference, Mr. Mitzna denounced Labor rivals he did not identify, accusing them of putting ''personal interests before the party.'' Mr. Mitzna said he had been urged to ''be more seamy, more manipulative.'' But, he added, ''I refuse to become the mirror reflection of my own party.'' 
 Labor is likely to pick a new leader by August, party officials said. Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, Mr. Sharon's former defense chief, lost the leadership to Mr. Mitzna in November and is expected to try to regain it."

 A man whose eyes were gouged during a scuffle with his roommate died in the hospital of a heart attack on Sunday, four days after the argument, the police said yesterday. The man, Oscar Herrera, 53, of East Elmhurst, and his roommate, Hector Castillo, 51, were arguing over a broken television antenna in their home at 100-30 Ditmars Boulevard. Mr. Castillo gouged Mr. Herrera's eyes with his fingers and fingernails, the police said. Both were arrested, and Mr. Castillo was charged with assault. Mr. Herrera suffered a heart attack at Elmhurst Hospital Center and died on Sunday night. The medical examiner's office will determine whether the death was linked to the assault, the police said.

"409","No Time To Lose In Iraq",1513470,"|opinion",20,8,2003,"20030820T000000","|Iraq|Baghdad (Iraq)|Iraq"," 
 I was stopped the other day at the U.S. Army checkpoint on the July 14 Bridge in the heart of Baghdad and told by the sergeant on duty that I didn't have the proper ID to enter the U.S. compound, which clogs the heart of the capital. So I called the U.S. Army officer I had an appointment with, and he offered to drive out to escort me in. To make certain he found me, I asked the sergeant who was running the checkpoint to take the phone and tell the officer exactly where we were standing. ''Sir,'' the sergeant said, ''we're on the enemy side of the July 14 bridge. . . .'' 
 ''Hmm,'' I thought to myself, ''the 'enemy side' of the July 14 Bridge? He's referring to Baghdad outside the walls of the U.S. compound.'' 
 I couldn't blame the sergeant for having that impression. The bad guys in Iraq have been gaining so much momentum in recent days -- with their attacks on pipelines, U.S. forces and the U.N. headquarters -- that they are steadily eroding the sense of partnership between U.S. forces and the Iraqi people. 
 The mounting attacks are forcing U.S. troops in Iraq to crouch more and more behind their own barricades, to mistrust more and more Iraqis, and to put up more and more roadblocks. There is now a huge cement wall being built around part of the U.S. compound in central Baghdad that is a carbon copy of the wall Israel is building in the West Bank. 
 The same is happening on the Iraqi side. The Pentagon, with its insistence on doing nation-building in Iraq on the cheap, has been too slow in forming a provisional Iraqi government, too slow in getting the electricity on, too slow in turning security over to Iraqis. As a result, while most Iraqis are happy to be rid of Saddam, too many feel that their lives are tangibly worse in every other respect -- jobs, electricity, roadblocks -- because of the U.S. presence. ''Saddam was paranoid, but he kept the streets open -- you're closing all the arteries,'' Muhammad Kadhim, a Baghdad professor, said to me. 
 Everyone has advice now for the U.S.: bring in U.N. peacekeepers, bring in the French. They're all wrong. There are only two things we need: more Americans out back and more Iraqis out front. President Bush needs to give the U.S. administrator, Paul Bremer III, more resources to get basic services here running and Iraqis in charge as fast as we can. This is not Germany 1945. America is much more radioactive in this region. We don't have infinite time. 
 Which is also why we need Iraqis out front -- fast. They need to be seen to be solving their own problems. They need to be manning the checkpoints because only they know who the good guys and bad guys are, and they need to be increasingly running the show so attacks on Iraq's infrastructure are seen and understood as attacks on Iraqis, not on us. 
 And, most important, we need them out front because the Iraqi silent majority is our only potential friend in this whole neighborhood. Everyone else wants America to fail. But we have not empowered that Iraqi silent majority enough, and it has been too timid and divided to step forward yet. ''The Iraqi people are the only ones in the area who have an interest in your success,'' said Masrour Barzani, the security chief for the Kurdistan Democratic Party, a real friend of America's. ''But you have not allowed that friendship to emerge.'' 
 It can only emerge if America gets the basics right -- water, jobs and electricity -- and lets Iraqis run things faster. ''Let [Iraqis] take the credit; let them take the blame,'' Mr. Barzani said. ''We need Iraqis to face their own problems and each other, and right now you're in the way.'' 
 I heard a similar message just a few days ago from Sergio Vieira de Mello, the chief U.N. officer in Baghdad, who was killed in yesterday's bombing. We met over Lebanese beer and pistachios at his hotel, and he told me how much he believed that Iraqis could build a different Iraq, if they were given half a chance. Like me, he was a congenital optimist who believed in people's better angels. His senseless death is heartbreaking. 
 It's also a challenge. Whoever blew up the U.N. office in Baghdad was trying to blow up Iraq's future. Yes, America must work harder now and devolve more power to Iraqis faster. But when all is said and done, only Iraqis can rescue this place. Only they can show us whether the diverse communities that make up this nation can rule themselves and take on their evil angels within. Only they can prove whether Iraqis are a nation with a collective will to be free and united. Only they can really tell us the true identity of the people on the other side of the July 14 bridge.

"410","In Defense Of Willful Directors",1514558,"|arts|theater",24,8,2003,"20030824T000000",NA," 
 WE live in a theatrical age in which stage directors have assumed an ever more prominent place in the creative process. They mount productions of classics in ways the writers would never recognize. They forcefully shape the writing of new plays. They even create their own plays, sometimes relegating text to a subsidiary position, as Robert Wilson has done. 
 This steadily evolving influence has provoked overwrought complaints in the theater world, a world that very much includes opera. This summer alone, whether it was Mark Wing-Davey's production of Shakespeare's ''Henry V'' in Central Park, with all those chairs, or the varied approaches in the Kirov Opera season at the Metropolitan Opera, some people hate just about anything they perceive as untraditional. 
 Even dead people are getting into the act, as in the estate of the late philanthropist Sybil Harrington, which recently sued the Metropolitan Opera for spending her money on a telecast of a production of Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde'' that her executors said wasn't traditional enough for her (dead) tastes. 
 The considered critical response to all this is ''Whoa, Nelly.'' Theater has always been a collective, collaborative art. Over the centuries the relationship among the various creative forces has constantly changed. What the balance was in Shakespeare's time is utterly different from what it is today. 
 Or is it? One way to bridge a gulf of time and place is to ignore it -- by trying, say, to recreate just what Shakespeare's plays might have looked like 400 years ago. The rebuilt Globe Theater in London is an American vision (Sam Wanamaker) realized by a British artistic director (Mark Rylance). The performances there -- judged from a ''Richard III'' this summer with Kathryn Hunter in the title role -- may not embody every single speculation as to what performances at the Globe or the Rose might precisely have been like. But they come pretty close, and can be pretty wonderful. 
 Change is neither good nor bad. Presumably the best productions of brand-new works have a decent chance of reflecting the creators' intention (although even here, only a minor lapse of time can cause major problems, as in the attempts of Samuel Beckett's estate to suppress stagings that differ from his stage directions). Productions of centuries-old works, like ''Henry V,'' become more problematic, whatever the balance of pedantic reinstatement and poetic evocation. 
 ''Traditional'' is a slippery word. One could imagine a ''Henry V'' set anywhere from the Globe to an East German public toilet (I can assure you that there must have been one). The Met's venerable version of Wagner's ''Ring,'' beloved by some as an insight into what Wagner really wanted, looks to me more like what venerable donors might have seen in their childhood in the 1930's. 
 Willful directors can either enliven or distort. Enliven, if they accept the gulf between a playwright's time and immediate intentions on the one hand and the sensibilities of today on the other, and set up a critical dialogue between past and present, text and audience. Distort, if they just lay a simple-minded, ideologically monolithic interpretation on a multi-faceted play (Georg Büchner's ''Woyzeck'' about, and only about, the evils of money, symbolized by dollars, as was recently done in Germany). 
 The temptation to distort is particularly powerful in a climate that discourages the new, like commercially cautious Broadway or the West End today. Or when the creators, like so many modernist composers, have drifted from the audience. Easier to feed the theatrical and operatic maw by tossing it proven hits, but spicing them up to slake the yearning for novelty. 
 Bold or brain-dead direction has been more common on the continent of Europe than in the more conservative, word-driven theatrical climate of the English-speaking world, no matter what the nationality of the director (cf. Mr. Wilson and Peter Sellars). In Europe it sometimes seems as if there are theaters every few miles, and everyone who cares has seen ''Henry V'' a hundred times. 
 My own response is to focus on the merits and demerits of whatever production I'm seeing right now, and to avoid the sweeping pronunciamentos of someone like Michael Feingold. Mr. Feingold, inspired by ''Henry V'' and the Kirov visit, recently unburdened himself of linked essays in two successive Village Voices decrying contemporary stage direction: ''Under the black umbrella of postmodernism,'' he wrote, ''visionary directing and the deflationary subversive kind formed an unholy merger, and the target of their takeover was the classic repertoire.'' 
 Gosh. With all due respect to dramaturgy, I have never encountered a theory of theater that could explain why productions in any style work or not. Of course there are witless, arrogant, over-the-top directors, just like there are boring playwrights, ranting actors and no-talent celebrities. But some ''subversive'' productions are brilliantly unforgettable, like Mr. Wilson's account of ''A Dream Play'' three years ago at the Brooklyn Academy. Mr. Wilson revealed facets of Strindberg that Strindberg himself could never have envisaged, making for a compelling dialogue across time. Success or failure depends on particulars, not on generalist theory. 
 When the playwright ruled in Elizabethan theater, the world was bequeathed some great plays, in part because words are more durable than the ephemera of theatrical production. But there are still great plays being written today (Tom Stoppard, anyone?), just as composers managed to write great operas when singers ruled the operatic stage. It's the shifting creative balance that keeps theater alive. Deal with it.

 Though both sides were peppered with difficult questions at yesterday's argument in the California recall case, those posed to the civil rights groups that seek to delay the election were more concrete and direct, suggesting that at least the more conservative judges on the 11-judge panel are inclined to let the election take place next month. 
 The questions posed to the other side were often abstract and hypothetical, seemingly asked out of curiosity rather than practical necessity. 
 Even some of the civil rights groups' more likely allies on the panel of the court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, seemed to be looking for a narrow, technical and inoffensive way to allow the election to go forward. These judges were particularly interested in whether a settlement in an earlier lawsuit that required punch-card balloting to be phased out by March might forbid the civil rights groups from pursuing their case now because some of them were also parties to that suit. 
 Laurence M. Tribe, the Harvard Law School professor who represented the losing side in the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore in 2000, was one of two lawyers who argued for the civil rights groups. He had barely started when the panel's three most conservative members asked him a series of questions that did not bode well for his clients. 
 Judge Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, asked why the court should not defer to the decision of Judge Stephen V. Wilson of the federal district court in Los Angeles, who had allowed the election to go forward in a decision last month. 
 Judge Alex Kozinski, another Reagan appointee, challenged the factual premise of the civil rights groups' arguments, saying that a study they had relied on to show discrimination against some voters was inadequate. 
 And Judge Andrew J. Kleinfeld, who was appointed by the first President Bush, quoted from the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore in an attempt to demonstrate that the case was not only of no help to the civil rights groups but also required that the recall election go forward. 
 A three-judge panel of the appeals court had reversed Judge Wilson's decision last Monday, holding that the disproportionate error rates associated with the punch-card balloting used in six large California counties required a delay, particularly because those counties have large minority populations. 
 But the decision of the full court on Friday to have an 11-judge panel rehear the case wiped out the smaller panel's decision, and the argument yesterday was treated as an appeal from Judge Wilson's ruling. Appellate courts ordinarily review decisions about requests for injunctions like the one Judge Wilson denied with substantial deference. 
 Mark D. Rosenbaum, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U. Foundation of Southern California, also argued for the civil rights groups. He spent much of his argument addressing Judge Kozinski's questions about whether some punch-card ballots might be spoiled intentionally, or, if not, whether some mistakes might be correctable in a manual recount. 
 Judge Kozinski, a conservative with a libertarian streak, was active in the first half of the argument and dominant in the second. He posed difficult but hypothetical questions to Douglas J. Woods, a deputy attorney general, and Charles P. Diamond, who represents a proponent of the recall, Ted Costa. 
 ''What if L.A. County said, 'We're only going to count every other vote?' '' he asked Mr. Diamond, who suggested that a showing of intentional discrimination should be required before a court stepped in. 
 Judge Kozinski seemed to collect his thinking toward the end of the argument. ''There comes a point,'' he said to Mr. Diamond, ''where if the machinery is defective enough in counting votes even your client would agree that there's an equal protection violation.'' 
 This was more a statement than a question. What little Judge Kozinski betrayed about whether that point had been reached in this case suggested he believed it had not. 
 If the court follows its usual practices, the senior judge in the majority will assign the writing of the decision. Chief Judge Mary M. Schroeder, a Jimmy Carter appointee, is that judge, and she said little yesterday beyond telling lawyers when their time was up. 
 Rory K. Little, a professor at Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco said Chief Judge Schroeder was ''very liberal, though she tries to hide it.'' At the same time, she has expressed concerns about the reputation of the Ninth Circuit for making decisions out of step with those of other federal appeals courts and the United States Supreme Court. 
 If she is in dissent, Judge Kozinski, the next most senior judge, would assign the opinion, and many legal experts predicted he would write it himself. He is known for the care he takes in fashioning his decisions. 
 ''Writing a precedential opinion,'' he wrote in a 2001 decision, ''involves much more than deciding who wins and who loses in a particular case. It is a solemn judicial act that sets the course of the law for hundreds or thousands of litigants and potential litigants. When properly done, it is an exacting and extremely time-consuming task.'' 
 In this case, the court is expected to decide the case in days. It must do so if the Supreme Court is to have any opportunity to weigh in before the Oct. 7 election date.

 Amanda Church is an artist. She is also a pragmatist. Ms. Church, whose anthropomorphic abstract paintings in Pucci-esque hues of mauve and pink are on view at the Artek Gallery in Chelsea, sat in her Manhattan studio last week caressing a fleshy pink Fendi bag. She was thrilled, she said, to have been asked by Fendi to embellish the company's latest handbag, which it calls its ''chef'' bag, with her own artwork: fabric-stuffed letters stitched inside that spell out ''Fendi.'' The bag, one of several commissioned by Fendi from contemporary artists, will be auctioned at a benefit in November for the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo. 
 ''It's awesome for an artist to be connected with fashion,'' Ms. Church said. Many of the young collectors she is eager to reach are proud possessors of pricey Fendi handbags. ''As an artist the more connected you are with that world, the better,'' she said. ''Besides, fashion has a lot of allure and glamour, something I think the art world hasn't quite achieved. '' 
 Ms. Church, whose single concession to comfort is an overstuffed sofa near the door of her studio, would seem an unlikely partner for the Italian luxury-goods maker, whose wares tend to be fetishized by cosseted plutocrats. But their union, a marriage of culture and commerce, is the latest in a proliferating series of similar collaborations. The trend dates at least to Elsa Schiaparelli, the fashion designer who famously deployed Salvador Dalí, Jean Cocteau and other surrealists to embellish her wares (she is the subject of ''Shocking!,'' a current exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art). In the past the partners in such ventures espoused art for art's sake. These days, each has one eye on the bottom line. 
 Such mergers, with their potential to give an overexposed brand new vitality, are especially pertinent at a time when the luxury business is ailing. ''Sometimes the collaboration is no more than a marketing ploy,'' observed Lisa Koenigsberg, the director of programs in the arts at the New York University school of continuing education. ''The idea is to make the consumer feel he is getting the enhanced value of a limited edition, like buying a print at the Pace gallery,'' she said. 
 The fusion of fashion and art has gained momentum in recent months, as high-end stores have joined luxury labels in the game. Tourists on Fifth Avenue can stop by Ferragamo's rambling new store to view an installation of art by artists like Vanessa Beecroft, Jeff Burton and Sylvie Fleury. They can visit a new Giorgio Armani boutique at Bergdorf Goodman, now displaying the works of artists participating next month in Artwalk NY, a series of events to benefit the Coalition for the Homeless. 
 At times, juxtaposition of fashion with fine art can leave passers-by scratching their heads. Lord & Taylor's Fifth Avenue windows are currently shared by the raucously comical canvases of the artist Red Grooms and a series of scarlet evening dresses. The connection? Apparently just the artist's red-orange palette, and his first name. ''The dresses are red,'' said Janis Gardner Cecil, sales director for the Marlborough Gallery, which lent Lord & Taylor the paintings. The department store did not respond to a reporter's calls. 
 In October, in Beverly Hills, Bottega Veneta boutique plans to exhibit the work of Nancy Lorenz, a maker of boxes inlaid with landscape designs. And Nike will invite 25 Japanese artists to create works inspired by its 1986 white Dunk sneaker, for an exhibition in Paris next month. 
 In such cases, both fashion maker and fine artist seem eager to borrow some of the other's allure. As well they might. For both, the payoff can be handsome. Such mergers confer on the artist an unhoped-for celebrity. (How many Americans had heard of Takashi Murakami, the Japanese artist, before he splashed his colorful cartoonlike designs on a Louis Vuitton bag?) 
 Designers in particular ''have been plugging into a different cultural light socket -- and it lights up,'' said Meredith Etherington-Smith, the editor in chief of Art Review, a London monthly, whose current issue is devoted to the intersection of fashion and fine art. Ms. Etherington-Smith was referring to the Vuitton-Murakami partnership, a marketing tour de force so spectacular it created a waiting list in the thousands for versions of the bag, the company says. 
 To many consumers, such partnerships appear to elevate the wares, and to transform shopping from a guilty pleasure to a high-minded pursuit. Such, at least, is the hope of Jan-Patrick Schmitz, the chief executive of Montblanc, who commissioned 10 artists, including Sam Taylor-Wood, Gary Hume and David La Chapelle, to embellish 10-foot-high shopping bag sculptures, which will be displayed in Rockefeller Center next month to mark the opening of a new Manhattan store. The exhibit reinforces the notion that ''shopping is a higher art form,'' Mr. Schmitz said, hijacking an argument popularized by writers who track consumer shopping habits. 
 In any event, publicizing a store opening with art trumps an opening that features ''the typical boring velvet rope and Champagne -- and the getting of celebrities,'' he said. 
 The fusion of fashion and art is sometimes promoted as the latest antidote to widespread consumer fatigue. ''Store openings are a dime a dozen,'' said Robert Burke, the fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman. ''A hard sell for clothing is stale,'' he added. ''Customers no longer come in just to see new clothes.'' Especially in Manhattan, where social events compete with shopping for affluent patrons' attention, retailers are compelled to impress their public with a dollop of high culture. By linking fashion to the art world ''you jazz it up, you provide spectacle,'' Ms. Koenigsberg said. ''And when it comes to that dazzling spectacle, who doesn't want to be included?'' 
 Those spectacles can be particularly potent at a moment when art itself has expanded its reach. ''The old days of art-as-couture are over,'' Ms. Etherington-Smith said. ''Art has become much more democratized.'' 
 Evidently not democratic enough, though, for cultural institutions like the New Museum, which increasingly find themselves hanging onto fashion's coattails for support. The museum will hold its Fendi-sponsored benefit with the object of courting a broader public, said Lisa Phillips, a director of the museum. ''The audience for any kind of crossover activity is wider,'' she said, ''but fashion is certainly something more people relate to as being a part of their daily lives.'' 
 Such partnerships, which often are subsidized by the big design houses, may well erode the already slender boundary between fine art and commerce. But their proponents see no problem here. Ms. Phillips, for one, shrugged off such concerns, citing historic precedents. ''Since Andy Warhol, expectations about the artist and the marketplace have changed rapidly,'' Ms. Phillips said. ''In a post-Warholian world, all of it flies.''"

 'Tales of Unrest: Joseph Conrad on Stage'  Baruch Performing Arts Center 
 It would be a mistake to say that ''Tales of Unrest: Joseph Conrad on Stage'' is Conrad Lite, but its two one-acts from Conrad stories and presented by two companies rest easier in the imagination than his writing usually does. 
 The first, produced by Fluid Motion Theater & Film, is ''Arsat,'' adapted from ''The Lagoon'' by Christine Simpson, who directs it. Arsat, a South Pacific islander, sits at the bed of a woman dying of fever in a house haunted by Arsat's dead brother. An English plantation owner stops by for a farewell drink before he sails home, summoned by a dying father whom this coarse son ridicules and sneers at for having doubted he could succeed abroad. 
 As the men talk Arsat reveals a suffocating secret: Arsat, once a great warrior, had kidnapped this woman from a king's entourage, and his brother was cut down, with knives in both hands, in fighting off enraged courtiers while Arsat escaped with his captive. As he finishes his tale, he realizes the woman is dead, and her death releases the spirit of his brother, who leaves a knife on the floor as a sign. 
 Only the two men have spoken lines. The woman and the ghost are silent, but the eloquence of their gestures gives shape to the others' speech, and the ironic comment Arsat's story makes on the colonizer's vision of life resounds in our minds. 
 ''One Day More'' is Conrad's own dramatization of his story ''To-Morrow.'' Here it is presented by the National Asian American Theater and directed by Jonathan Bank of the Mint Theater. In an English village a rich old man went mad after his son fled from the father's domestic tyranny 16 years ago to become a seaman, and the father now pleads for his return in London newspaper ads. One day the delinquent turns up, but the father does not recognize him and turns him away with dire threats. 
 A young woman next door, practically enslaved by her blind, frightened father, realizes who the son is and tries passionately to persuade him to stay for her sake. Their cautious debate over freedom and fate, and about their own desires, is nearly heartbreaking when one feels what it is really all about. 
 The sensitivity and restraint of all the actors is the key to the power of these two little plays. They last about 75 minutes together and amply fill an evening.

 A GOOD seven hours remained before the close of the polls yesterday, but Patrick Hurley, the Republican candidate for the City Council in Woodside and its environs, needed sustenance. With the misty rain outside, it was proving to be a soft day, and a hard one as well. 
 The waitress at Shane's Bakery, just off Roosevelt Avenue, presented him first with a pot of tea. Then came a plate heavy with coarse-cut bacon, plump sausages, and two eggs staring right at him, as if to say: 
 What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be out campaigning? 
 He grabbed a piece of toast and poked one right in the yolk. 
 Somewhere out there, his opponent, a young Democratic incumbent named Eric Gioia, was shaking hands, thanking people for coming out on such a raw day, asking them for their vote. He in his dark blue suit, white shirt, and red tie, ignoring the inclement weather because that is one of the strange ways that politicians show they care. 
 If, God forbid, Mr. Gioia caught a cold, well at least he had raised enough money -- more than $300,000 -- to cover the cost of some Robitussin. He also had enough Gioia signs plastered around the district to spare a few for a nice warm fire. And, of course, he could always get a toasty group hug from that army of 200 volunteers out there, all wearing ''Eric Gioia Team'' T-shirts. 
 And what did Patrick Hurley have? About $12,000 in contributions, about one twenty-fifth of what Mr. Gioia had raised. About 10 volunteers, including some not even from his district: Dermot from County Kerry and upstate; Gerald, from County Mayo and the Bronx. 
 As for signs, Mr. Hurley had just been informed that the folks at a local restaurant had removed his placard Monday night -- but left a Gioia one intact. 
 ''And I probably eat in there three times a week,'' said Mr. Hurley, 41, his brogue as heavy as the meal before him. He muttered something about never eating there again, and punctured a sausage with his fork. 
 There was a time when it seemed that you had to be an Irish-American and a Democrat to be elected to the City Council from the 26th District in Queens, despite its healthy ethnic diversity. You had to be able to name the county in Ireland where your people were from; you had to be able to at least mouth the lyrics to ''The Wild Colonial Boy.'' 
 That effectively ended in 2001 when Mr. Gioia, a lawyer, challenged the Democratic Party leadership and defeated several candidates with Irish surnames. He had his own kind of name recognition. His family has owned the Nunziato flower shop on Roosevelt Avenue for more than a century. He went to P.S. 11; he attends Mass at St. Sebastian's. 
 No Democrat challenged him this year, leaving the task to Mr. Hurley, a security director for a hotel. Mr. Hurley presented himself as an Irish immigrant who was grounded both in Woodside and in traditional values, as opposed to Mr. Gioia, whom he portrayed as an out-of-touch liberal who had already set his sights on higher office. 
 ''Really, really from the neighborhood,'' read Mr. Hurley's campaign literature. ''Not just passing through.'' 
 MR. HURLEY flashed a mischievous smile, there above his yolk-stained plate, when asked whether he enjoyed the support of Democrats of Irish descent still smarting from the success of young Mr. Gioia, who is 30. Such information, he said, was ''privileged.'' 
 ''Let's put it this way,'' he said. ''There are people in the Democratic Party who'd like to say 'au revoir' to Eric.'' 
 Among them, presumably, was the woman who approached Mr. Gioia last weekend to criticize him for favoring the right to abortion -- just as he was about to receive holy communion at the altar of St. Sebastian's. But in the campaign of 2003, her action was a mere blip of opposition in the continuing ascendance of that local boy whose family owns the flower shop. 
 As he sipped the last of his tea, Mr. Hurley seemed to sense that he had as much chance against Mr. Gioia as the eggs had had against his fork. After joking that his last-minute campaigning would include some praying, he paid his bill and went out into the midafternoon wetness. 
 A few minutes later, Mr. Hurley pulled his green van in front of a polling station where Mr. Gioia was campaigning. Then, as his opponent watched in disbelief, a red-faced Mr. Hurley climbed up a streetlamp to rip down a Gioia sign. 
 It was unclear whether this gesture reflected defiance or futility. Perhaps the kindest interpretation is simply that Mr. Hurley's late Irish breakfast had not agreed with him.

"417","Mary Pinkett, First Black Councilwoman, 72",1540553,"|business|obituaries",5,12,2003,"20031205T000000","|New York City"," 
 Mary Pinkett, a labor advocate from Brooklyn who became the first African-American woman elected to the New York City Council, died yesterday. She was 72. 
 The cause was heart failure brought on by cancer, said her nephew, Derek Glover. 
 As a young woman in Brooklyn, Mrs. Pinkett worked for a local labor union. She was interested in politics and traveled to Miami in 1972 for the Democratic National Convention. Archie Spigner, a council member from Queens who would later serve alongside Mrs. Pinkett, recalled noticing the articulate young woman. 
 ''She was a real presence,'' he said last night. 
 A year after the convention, Mrs. Pinkett ran for City Council in New York and won. She took office in 1974, and remained on the Council until 2001. During her tenure, she applied her skill as a speaker and debater to fight for social equality for the working class, women, and African-Americans. 
 Mrs. Pinkett ''served the people of Brooklyn with compassion, dedication and a fiery sense of purpose for nearly 30 years,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday in a statement. 
 Mrs. Pinkett was a skilled, sometimes intimidating debater. In hearings, it was not uncommon for her to engage in spirited discussions with administration officials, often cutting them off in midsentence. Even among her colleagues in the Council, there were many who acknowledged that they would not wish to be challenged by her. 
 Mrs. Pinkett, whose maiden name was Glover, lived her entire life in Brooklyn. She spent her childhood in Crown Heights, attended Brooklyn College and later moved to Clinton Hill. 
 Her knowledge of Brooklyn was profound, and she was able to reveal little-known corners of the borough even to veteran New Yorkers. 
 She remained a strong presence in New York City politics throughout her life, even after term limit laws forced her from office. 
 The candidate she endorsed as her successor was James E. Davis, who was killed at City Hall in July. Mr. Davis often said that he considered the councilwoman's endorsement as having been critical in his election. 
 Mrs. Pinkett is survived by her husband, William, whom she married in the late 1950's, and a sister, Loretta Glover."

 The software maker SAP warned yesterday that its revenue declined 3 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the period a year earlier, but that it was slightly better than analysts had expected. On a preliminary basis, revenue fell to 930 million euros ($1.2 billion) as a result of weak corporate demand and currency effects, the company said. SAP, which is based in Germany, said it had expected its operating margin to exceed the previously forecast 25 percent for 2003.

"420","Ex-WorldCom Chief Pleads Not Guilty to Fraud",1563763,"|business",4,3,2004,"20040304T000000",NA," 
 Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, pleaded not guilty yesterday to charges of conspiracy and fraud growing out of the accounting scandal that drove the company into bankruptcy protection in 2002. 
 Mr. Ebbers, 62, was brought to Federal District Court in Manhattan in handcuffs after turning himself in to the F.B.I. yesterday morning, a day after the charges against him were announced at a news conference led by Attorney General John Ashcroft. 
 Mr. Ebbers is accused of conspiring with Scott D. Sullivan, WorldCom's former chief financial officer, to conceal the company's weakening performance starting in 2000 and participating in fraudulent reports to Wall Street and regulators about its finances. 
 Legal experts said his determination to fight the criminal charges set the stage for what was likely to be the single most dramatic confrontation in the sprawling and still expanding array of legal battles linked to the $11 billion accounting fraud and bankruptcy protection case at WorldCom. 
 ''These aren't going to be easy cases,'' said Jill Fisch, director of the Fordham Center for Corporate, Securities and Finance Law, referring to the charges against Mr. Ebbers and Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former chief executive of Enron, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud, insider trading and conspiracy. 
 Until recently, she said, it was rare for the government to attempt to tie chief executives to misconduct by their financial subordinates. 
 In addition to Mr. Ebbers and WorldCom, which is planning to emerge from bankruptcy protection this spring and be renamed MCI, the WorldCom legal landscape is crowded with investors, underwriters, lenders, insurers, accountants, current and former employees, former directors and state and federal regulators. 
 Just this week, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it was filing a new civil suit against Mr. Sullivan. And a coalition of states will soon decide whether to file claims seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes from WorldCom, based on records suggesting that it improperly reduced taxable earnings in their states -- and increased overall net income -- by classifying billions of dollars of revenue as nontaxable royalty payments to the parent company. 
 Judge Barbara S. Jones, who on Tuesday accepted a guilty plea from Mr. Sullivan on the same criminal charges filed against Mr. Ebbers, set a Nov. 9 trial date for Mr. Ebbers. But William Johnson, an assistant United States attorney, said that the government planned to file a new indictment adding additional charges and naming other defendants, which would most likely lead to a postponement of the trial. 
 Mr. Ebbers's bail was set at $10 million. He was released after offering his home in Brookhaven, Miss., as security, along with the co-signature of his wife, Kristie Ebbers. 
 Mr. Ebbers also agreed to a ban on traveling outside of Mississippi, Louisiana, Washington, D.C., and New York City. 
 Speaking for Mr. Ebbers, his lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten, said that Mr. Ebbers had never sought to mislead investors and had ''never received a dime he is not entitled to.'' 
 The travel restrictions could create a conflict for Mr. Ebbers if Oklahoma's attorney general, W.A. Drew Edmondson, filed criminal charges against him in the next few weeks, as he has pledged to do. 
 Mr. Edmondson filed a criminal securities fraud case last summer against WorldCom, Mr. Ebbers, Mr. Sullivan and four other former executives, contending that their illegal conduct had cost the state's pension funds $64 million. 
 Mr. Edmondson later dropped the charges against Mr. Ebbers to avoid interfering with the federal investigation of him and the government's plans to prosecute Mr. Sullivan. But he pledged to reindict Mr. Ebbers by the end of March, and a spokesman for Mr. Edmondson said yesterday that the federal charges against Mr. Ebbers had not affected those plans. 
 Federal authorities moved quickly in 2002 as the lawsuits involving WorldCom mushroomed to consolidate as many of the disputes as possible in the Southern District of New York, where WorldCom's bankruptcy case had begun. Scores of class-action suits by investors against individuals and companies that may have played roles in the securities fraud, the cases filed on behalf of WorldCom's employees' pension funds and numerous suits filed by individuals have been assigned to Judge Denise L. Cote. 
 WorldCom itself has been protected from most of the private civil lawsuits because it has been operating under bankruptcy protection. But it has been drawn into battles over issues like the right of former shareholders of its MCI tracking stock to sue its former directors for failing to pay them promised dividends. 
 Some cases are extremely complex. The class-action complaint filed on behalf of New York State Common Retirement Fund, the nation's second-largest pension fund, runs 257 pages, names more than 35 defendants and cites suspected accounting misconduct as far back as the beginning of 1999, a year and a half before the earliest wrongdoing mentioned in the criminal charges against Mr. Ebbers. 
 That class-action lawsuit -- and many others -- also delves into conduct ignored in the criminal case, like Mr. Ebbers's mutually beneficial financial links with Salomon Brothers and other units of its parent, Citigroup. Richard Thornburgh, the examiner appointed by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez in WorldCom's bankruptcy, has said those links generated millions of dollars of extra income for Mr. Ebbers and later helped him prop up his sagging finances but violated his duty to put the interests of WorldCom and its shareholders ahead of his own. 
 Judge Cote has set Jan. 10, 2005, as the first day of trial on the consolidated securities fraud lawsuits and March 14, 2005, as the opening trial date for the employee funds. 
 Meanwhile, other private lawsuits that have not been consolidated in New York are continuing in several states. In one recently filed case in Florida, Jack and Elaine Holtsberg, a couple who decided not to join the class action in New York, sued Mr. Sullivan, Citigroup, and its subsidiaries who employed Jack Grubman, WorldCom's most influential supporter on Wall Street. The couple said the company had used fraud to induce them to buy WorldCom stock in the late 1990's, 2000 and 2001, and lost nearly $2 million. 
 Still to come is WorldCom's decision whether to seek compensation from Mr. Ebbers, other former employees, former directors and others who might be liable for conduct that contributed to the companies woes. WorldCom has said it has no intention of suing KPMG, the accounting firm that designed the tax reduction plan now being questioned by many states. 
 ''We have no comment on the other possibilities,'' said Peter Lucht, a spokesman."
"421","Nissan Profit Up as Luxury Models Sell Well",1577277,"|business",27,4,2004,"20040427T000000",NA," 
 The Nissan Motor Company on Monday posted a small gain in net profit for the fiscal year that just ended, as strong sales in the United States of its luxury Infiniti line and other Nissan vehicles helped offset the damage caused by a rising yen. 
 Nissan's net income for the year ended March 31 was 503.7 billion yen ($4.63 billion), up 1.7 percent from 495.2 billion yen in the period a year earlier, because of robust sales of the Infiniti G35 and the Altima sedans and the introduction of vehicles, like the Murano crossover sport utility vehicle, in segments where Nissan did not compete before. 
 Operating profit was 825 billion yen ($7.6 billion), up 11.9 percent from a year earlier. The figure showed that the company remained one of the most profitable of automakers, with an operating profit margin of 11.1 percent. 
 ''We were able to absorb all the negative impact of the adverse change in exchange rates and still meet the numbers,'' said Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Nissan. 
 The company forecast net profit of 510 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 2005, which would be an increase of 1.25 percent from the year just ended. 
 The rising profits show that Nissan is building on a turnaround begun after the French automaker Renault bought a controlling stake in the Japanese company in 1999 and dispatched a team of executives, led by Mr. Ghosn, to lead a rigorous turnaround of the company. 
 Mr. Ghosn, who has become a corporate hero in Japan, announced a new set of company goals on Monday, among them expanding global vehicle sales to 4.2 million for the year ending March 2008 from just over 3 million in the year just ended. To reach the goal, Mr. Ghosn said that Nissan would expand sales in China, the Middle East and other developing markets and make its luxury Infiniti line a global brand. Currently, Infiniti is mostly a North American brand. 
 ''Infiniti has demonstrated it's able to compete globally,'' Mr. Ghosn said. 
 Nissan, Japan's second-largest carmaker after Toyota Motor, posted revenue of 7.429 trillion yen ($68.3 billion) for the fiscal year that just ended, up 8.8 percent from 6.829 trillion yen in the period a year earlier, as the number of vehicles sold around the world expanded 10.4 percent, to 3.06 million. 
 This was the fourth consecutive year of record earnings for Nissan, which was skidding toward bankruptcy when Mr. Ghosn began carrying out his turnaround plan five years ago. Renault now owns 44 percent of Nissan. 
 In the first years of the turnaround, Nissan's profit growth was driven largely by cost cuts as Mr. Ghosn's team pushed suppliers to lower prices. 
 This time around, however, the biggest contribution to profit growth was Nissan's ability to sell more vehicles even as it reduced discounts, a sign that efforts to spice up the Nissan and Infiniti lines with bolder designs are paying off. 
 The sporty Infiniti G35 sedan and G35 coupe have been hits with American car buyers and the curvy Murano has been selling well in an area where Nissan previously did not offer a vehicle, the crossover segment of autos that share attributes of cars and sport utility vehicles. 
 Not all of Nissan's new vehicles have been successes. Sales of its Quest minivan, marketed as a vehicle for cool suburban mothers, are below the company's forecasts. 
 ''You cannot expect that every product is going to be a hit,'' Mr. Ghosn said. He added, however, that he expected ''good surprises will more than offset bad surprises.'' 
 The strength of Nissan's Infiniti line made a big contribution to the company's profit growth for the year just ended. While the luxury line accounted for just 4 percent of Nissan's global sales volume, it accounted for 8 percent of revenue and 12 percent of operating profit, Mr. Ghosn said. 
 And so it is no wonder that the company now plans to introduce the Infiniti line to more markets around the world. Nissan will first roll out Infiniti vehicles in South Korea and then in Japan, Russia, China and eventually in Europe. Some vehicles sold as Infinitis in the United States are already sold in Japan as Nissans. 
 The move to make Infiniti a global brand comes after Toyota announced last year that it would begin selling its Lexus line of luxury vehicles around the world. Lexus, too, began as a brand for the North American market. 
 Nissan forecast global auto sales of 3.38 million vehicles in the year ending in March 2005. 
 Nissan is the first Japanese carmaker to announce earnings for the fiscal year just ended. Toyota Motor is also expected to post a record net profit."
"422","The Banal Faces Of Khmer Rouge Evil",1581932,"|movies|arts",16,5,2004,"20040516T000000","|Cambodia|Cambodia"," 
 THE Cambodian director Rithy Panh doesn't want to talk about the number of dead -- the 1.7 million of his countrymen (nearly one quarter of the population) who lost their lives from 1975 to 1979, under the murderous Khmer Rouge. And though his personal losses during that time were great, he would rather not speak of them. Americans today struggle to comprehend how a few seemingly normal people, stationed in Iraq, could have so cruelly abused the prisoners they oversaw. But Mr. Rithy Panh, looking back, is faced with the transformation of vast numbers of his fellow citizens into instruments of torture and death. He finds it resists understanding. 
 ''You can kind of get it, if you consider the way people were indoctrinated, and the climate of terror that reigned at the time,'' he said in French, while in town last autumn for the screening of his documentary ''S21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine,'' at the New York Film Festival. ''But genocide is something you can never fully grasp. I think it was Primo Levi who said that understanding everything is almost the same as forgiving. He didn't want that, and he was right.'' 
 ''S21,'' which opens for a one-week run on Wednesday at Film Forum in Manhattan, focuses on the most notorious of the Khmer Rouge's many prisons: Tuol Sleng, also known as S21. Of an estimated 17,000 ''enemies of the state'' -- men, women, and children -- who passed through the gates of this former Phnom Penh school building, only a handful survived. This extraordinary film brings two of them -- Chum Mey, a mechanic, and Vann Nath, a painter -- together with a few of the men who once brutally guarded them. The outcome is at once a portrait of unfathomable evil, a testament to the dead and a step toward national reconciliation. 
 The initial encounter between torturer and victim came about by accident. In 1995, Mr. Rithy Panh was in Phnom Penh shooting ''Bophana, a Cambodian Tragedy,'' a documentary tracing the life of a woman who died at the prison, now the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum. Mr. Vann Nath, whose large-scale paintings try to recreate the horrors of internment there, happened to be on the set the day that Him Houy, who was deputy head of prison security, came to testify. ''Suddenly, I saw Nath sitting silently on the floor, smoking cigarette after cigarette, and trembling,'' Mr. Rithy Panh recalled. ''I was afraid he might lose control, or hurt himself. Then I saw him rise, and take Houy by the shoulder to see one of his canvases. He kept asking, 'Is this true or not?' And Houy would say, 'Yes, it's true, you haven't exaggerated.' 
 ''Unfortunately,'' he continued, ''we the victims also need the words of the perpetrators, to tell their side of the story.'' 
 Born in Phnom Penh, Mr. Rithy Panh was 11 when the Khmer Rouge came to power with plans to transform Cambodia into a communist agrarian utopia. His parents and sisters, forced into the countryside along with most of the population, died in the rice fields, of famine and illnesses left untreated for lack of medicine. Some of his brothers disappeared; other family members were executed. In 1979, he escaped from a forced labor camp, finding his way to Thailand and then to Paris, where he still lives. In 1985, he was admitted to France's national film school. 
 Since 1989, he has returned repeatedly to his homeland, making a dozen award-winning feature films and documentaries. ''The Land of the Wandering Souls'' (1999), for example, followed Cambodian workers laying a fiber optic cable; in the process, they unearthed the skulls and bones of Khmer Rouge victims, and their own memories of that era. The country's tragic past continues to haunt Mr. Rithy Panh, who said, ''Without that history, I would never have become a filmmaker.'' 
 He spent three years researching and shooting ''S21.'' ''The idea of putting victims and executioners together is very seductive, but it's also very tricky,'' he said. ''You don't want to be a voyeur. You have to develop a kind of ethic of the image.'' 
 Youk Chhang, director of the non-profit Documentation Center of Cambodia, which gathers information on Khmer Rouge atrocities, helped with the research for ''S21.''  ''It took time to find men like Houy,'' he said, ''to earn their trust and to distance ourselves from them emotionally.'' Speaking by telephone from Phnom Penh, he continued, ''The most difficult part was maintaining a professional attitude in the face of people we knew were part of a system that killed our family members.'' 
 The film begins with Mr. Him Houy sitting mute, rigid and cross-legged on the floor of his village home beside his parents -- ordinary peasants who can't understand how their son could have committed such crimes -- and absently holding his new-born child. The continuing trauma of that chapter of Cambodian history threatens to sever the natural ties between generations. 
 In one chilling sequence, Khieu Ches, who began working as a guard at S21 when he was 12 or 13, repeats in the building's now dilapidated and empty rooms the gestures he once used there daily -- shackling and unshackling the inmates, beating and humiliating them. Beneath his imaginary blows, innumerable ghosts surge forth. ''That man, who's now about 40, had great difficulty speaking of the past,'' Mr. Rithy Panh recalled. ''But his gestures, the memory of his body, came flooding back. Because someone trained him to do this. And the memory of the body never lies.'' 
 Others interviewed include a photographer and registrar who helped keep the prison's elaborate records, a former interrogator, and a ''doctor'' whose sole mission was to revive inmates so that they could be tortured further. All were part of a perversely efficient mechanism to invent new lives for the prisoners, transforming them into ''enemies'' before killing them. Present at many of these interviews, Mr. Vann Nath -- who survived in part because Khmer Rouge officials liked the portraits they commissioned from him -- acts as the film's conscience, calmly holding up a mirror to each of his ex-captors' acts of inhumanity. Despite his wounds, he seems the only man in full possession of his past. 
 Mr. Rithy Panh fervently supports the creation of an international tribunal to bring the aging Khmer Rouge leaders to trial. But prospects for such a trial remain uncertain. ''I am deeply dubious that these criminals will ever be brought to justice,'' said Nayan Chanda, a journalist who has written extensively on Cambodia. ''So this film will be even more appreciated as time goes by. Look, I don't know that there will ever be any accounting for what the French did in Algeria. But 'The Battle of Algiers' will remain.'' 
 Mr. Rithy Panh's sense of his film's historical value is tempered by his pain. ''I do what I can,'' he said. ''Whatever happens, I belong to a generation whose sleep will be visited by nightmares. But we must not leave that legacy for our children.''

"423","Richard Strong Is Not Expected to Face Criminal Changes",1582871,"|business",19,5,2004,"20040519T000000",NA," 
 Richard S. Strong will not face criminal charges from the New York attorney general for rapid trades he made in and out of mutual funds, people briefed on the talks said last night. 
 Mr. Strong, the founder of Strong Capital Management of Menomonee Falls, Wis., has been in negotiations with the attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, and other regulators to settle an investigation into trades he made in funds managed by Strong Capital. 
 Negotiations remained fluid yesterday, and an announcement could come today of either a settlement or a civil suit against Mr. Strong, these people said. 
 Mr. Spitzer had left open the possibility of a criminal case against Mr. Strong last October, when he disclosed the trading Mr. Strong had done for his own account. 
 ''There will be charges brought, the nature of which have yet to be defined,'' Mr. Spitzer said at the time. ''If you ever wanted proof that there were two sets of rules -- one for insiders and one for individual investors -- this is it.'' 
 A grand jury convened by Mr. Spitzer has been hearing evidence for months about the trades. But Mr. Spitzer concluded that it would be hard to successfully prosecute a criminal case because such market timing is not necessarily illegal, people briefed on the negotiations said. 
 Mr. Spitzer has brought criminal charges against several individuals associated with improper trading in funds but so far has not brought a criminal case against the leaders of any fund company. 
 Mr. Strong, 62, traded in and out of funds managed by his company on behalf of his own account and the accounts of family and friends, Mr. Spitzer has said. He made the trades despite language in fund documents indicating that his company discouraged the practice. 
 Mr. Strong, whose net worth has been estimated at $800 million by Forbes magazine, made about $600,000 on the trades, people briefed on the investigation have said. 
 Mr. Strong's lawyer, Stanley Arkin, has said his client did nothing wrong. ''I have nothing to report,'' Mr. Arkin said last night. ''There are very intense negotiations going on.'' 
 Mr. Strong, who resigned in December as chairman of Strong Capital, is eager to settle with regulators because the investigation is making it difficult for him to sell his majority interest in the company. The most likely buyer, Wells Fargo, does not want to commit to an acquisition until regulators resolve their investigation, said people briefed on the sale negotiations, which were announced last December. 
 Strong Capital disclosed in prospectuses for its funds that several regulators were investigating trading by employees of the company, including Mr. Strong. Besides Mr. Spitzer's office, the list includes the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Wisconsin attorney general and the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions. It has also received ''one or more'' subpoenas from the West Virginia attorney general and other regulatory agencies, the company said. 
 A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo and a spokesman for Strong Capital declined to comment on negotiations with regulators. A spokeswoman for Mr. Spitzer and a representative of the S.E.C. also declined comment. A spokesman for the Wisconsin attorney general could not be reached last night."
"424","Budget Madness",1583024,"|opinion",20,5,2004,"20040520T000000","|United States"," 
 Republican leaders from the House and Senate produced an irresponsible compromise on the federal budget resolution this week, which the House dutifully passed yesterday. The only hope for fiscal sanity now lies with the Senate, where members can retain their self-respect by refusing to cough up the necessary votes. 
 For months, the House and Senate have clashed over the latest round of President Bush's tax cuts. A narrow majority in the Senate insisted that the cuts should be paid for with offsetting spending reductions or increased taxes in other areas. The House Republicans and the Bush administration resisted -- undoubtedly because they know that there would be no way to compensate for tax cuts that would amount to an estimated $1.2 trillion over 10 years. 
 In the compromise, the conferees agreed to extend three key tax cuts for one year rather than permanently, as originally sought, and to enact a ''pay as you go'' rule for one year. But -- a big, big but -- the one-year ''pay as you go'' rule would not apply to the one-year extension of the three tax cuts. Presto! The new federal budget resolution allows for one more year of deficit-financed tax cuts, to the tune of some $28 billion. 
 This compromise is a bad election-year joke. Turning large, expensive chunks of the tax code into year-by-year renewals is no way to do tax policy. And an obsessive urge to pass unpaid-for tax cuts is no way to run a country."

 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg called yesterday on the homeland security secretary, Tom Ridge, to stand up to Congress over what the mayor has repeatedly characterized as its efforts to shortchange New York City on anti-terrorism money. 
 The mayor, appearing on his weekly radio program on WABC-AM, charged that Congress had turned the distribution of homeland security money into a political ''slush fund,'' in which small states receive far more dollars per capita than those states at greater risk, like New York. 
 ''This is a time for Tom Ridge to stand up and say, 'Enough of this craziness,''' the mayor said. ''He has got to be out there screaming. If we are going to protect this country, we've got to send the money where the threat is, and I don't think there's any question that the No. 1 targets for anybody overseas would be New York and, arguably, Washington.'' 
 In recent months, Mr. Bloomberg has directed his criticisms only at Congress, but after coming under attack from some of its members, he has begun to focus more on the Bush administration. Yesterday, the mayor said that he had placed a call to Mr. Ridge. 
 ''Everybody is at fault here, and everybody's got to get together and stop this craziness. This is not a pork barrel slush fund -- or shouldn't be,'' he said. 
 Brian Roehrkasse, a spokesman for the Homeland Security Department, said New York City had received more homeland security money -- about $300 million since 2002 -- than any other city. He added that the president's 2005 budget request allocated additional money to urban areas with greater security needs. 
 ''We believe that every state needs a minimum level of homeland security funding,'' he said. ''However, we recognize that areas with greater homeland security needs require more funds.'' 
 Mr. Bloomberg, expressing his frustration with Congress, said yesterday that its members ''all feel they have to deliver something for the hometown crowd, and sometimes, the leaders need a little prodding from the rest of us.'' He said that since terrorist threats were not distributed evenly across states, the money should not be, either. 
 ''People that don't have a great threat should feel relieved, but they shouldn't be getting the money,'' he said. ''People that do have the threat should be worried, but that's where the money should go.'' 
 The mayor also objected to proposed federal legislation that would allow a portion of the homeland security money to be spent on responding to natural disasters. 
 ''Somebody said to me, 'Well, we have to protect our crops because we need food supplies,''' the mayor said. ''Yes, you need food supplies, but I don't think there's many Al Qaeda members walking around with maps of cornfields.''"

"429","Cisco Reports Strong Revenue In 4th Quarter",1603159,"|technology|business",11,8,2004,"20040811T000000",NA," 
 Cisco Systems, the maker of Internet networking equipment, posted solid quarterly earnings on Tuesday that were squarely in line with Wall Street expectations. But John T. Chambers, the company's chief executive, suggested that economic conditions remain jittery, even more so than they were three months ago. 
 Mr. Chambers, whose sales efforts put him in contact with the country's most powerful executives, said he was hearing less optimism than he had three months earlier. While not necessarily expecting the economy to sour, customers have reverted to expressing a more cautious outlook, he said. 
 Three months ago, when Cisco last held a quarterly conference call with investors, Mr. Chambers said he was as enthusiastic as he had been in several years. On Tuesday, Mr. Chambers was more measured. 
 ''Most of the C.E.O.'s I talk with,'' Mr. Chambers said, ''view the economy as growing at a modest level and are a little more cautious in their outlook than they were a quarter ago.'' 
 However, he said he was heartened by the fact that demand for Cisco products from United States companies continued to rise and that, of particular note, orders from telecommunications service providers were the highest in three years. 
 For the quarter ended July 31, the company's fourth, Cisco had net income of $1.38 billion, or 20 cents a share, up 41 percent from $982 million, or 14 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
 Cisco had revenue of $5.9 billion, compared with $4.7 billion in the period a year earlier and $5.62 billion in the previous quarter. Analysts had expected Cisco to post sales of $5.88 billion. 
 On a pro forma basis, the company had earnings of 21 cents a share, compared with analysts' estimates of 20 cents. 
 The earnings news from Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., comes several weeks after two other technology industry bellwethers, I.B.M. and Microsoft, each posted solid quarterly results. However, their reports were also tempered, with Microsoft remaining cautious in its own outlook and I.B.M. reporting that it had noticed some pause in corporate technology spending. 
 The fourth quarter rounded out something of a rebuilding fiscal year for Cisco. Rebounding from the fallout of the dot-com collapse and the continued sluggishness in the telecommunications market, the company posted annual sales of $22 billion and earnings of 76 cents a share, compared with revenue of $18.9 billion and earnings of 59 cents a share in the 2003 fiscal year. 
 Steve Kamman, a network industry analyst with CIBC World Markets, said that if investors had foreseen the results a year ago, they ''would have been absolutely thrilled.'' But he added that investor expectations had changed and that the market was ''less enthusiastic across the board.'' 
 Before Cisco announced its results, its shares closed at $20.46, up 41 cents. They fell as low as $19.90 after hours. 
 Mr. Kamman said that Cisco's fourth-quarter earnings were strong but not remarkable. ''They're delivering well, but there are no fireworks,'' he said. ''The questions now are when do they step on the accelerator and how would they do that?'' 
 Within the broad brush strokes of Cisco's report, the finer points appeared to offer both cause for optimism and some mild concern for investors. 
 One potential trouble spot for Cisco, several industry analysts said, is that its inventories have been creeping up. That can be cause for concern because it can signal that the company has overestimated demand. 
 In Cisco's third fiscal quarter, inventory was $1.1 billion, up from $933 million in the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, it rose to $1.2 billion. 
 Mr. Chambers took pains during a conference call with analysts and reporters to allay any concern. He and Dennis Powell, the chief financial officer, attributed the rising inventories to a calculated effort to have the right level of supply to meet seasonal demand, particularly of back-to-school products. 
 ''We're not losing sleep over this at all,'' he said. ''This is an issue we'd view as secondary, and not a primary issue at all.'' 
 There was also a slight decrease in gross margin, which measures sales minus the cost of producing goods. Mr. Powell attributed the drop -- to 68.4 percent from 68.8 percent in the third quarter -- to some discounted prices and higher inventory. 
 On a potentially positive note for investors, the demand that Mr. Chambers said he was seeing from telecommunications service providers may be more than a revival in spending from those companies. It may indicate some success in Cisco's strategy of re-establishing ties with those companies after a fallout with some service providers during the dot-com boom. 
 For his part, Mr. Chambers received a personal financial gain, the company disclosed during its earnings conference call. Since April 2001, Mr. Chambers -- at his own request -- forfeited his salary and bonus, though he did continue to collect stock options potentially worth tens of millions of dollars. 
 However, the company said its board had approved paying Mr. Chambers $350,000 in annual salary, the same as he was receiving before the cutback in his pay.

 HIGHLIGHTS 
 THE ART OF SCIENCE -- The architect Cesar Pelli has been chosen to design the new $100 million Connecticut Center for Science and Exploration, which is to rise on a site overlooking the Connecticut River in downtown Hartford. The announcement ended a competition among finalists that included Moshe Safdie, Zaha Hadid and Stefan Behnisch. The trustees said the building would be designed during the next year. It is expected to be completed in winter 2007. In his proposal for the project, Mr. Pelli said: ''The Connecticut Center for Science and Exploration will be a building that will communicate the excitement of science to the surrounding streets, river and highway. The forms are ambitious and dynamic. They appear to reach out, beyond their physical limits.'' Among major projects by Cesar Pelli & Associates of New Haven is the current expansion of the Museum of Modern Art. 
 NOT FORGOTTEN -- The psychological thriller ''The Forgotten,'' starring Julianne Moore as a grieving mother who fears she is losing her sanity, shot to the top of the North American box office this weekend based on preliminary figures, Agence-France Presse reported. Exhibitor Relations, which tracks the box office, said ''The Forgotten'' dislodged ''Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow'' from the top spot and was expected to earn $22 million over its debut weekend. ''Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,'' the top film last week, dropped to second place, pulling in about $6.7 million. The baseball comedy ''Mr. 3000'' took third place, with receipts of $5 million, followed by ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' and the debut of ''First Daughter,'' with both films earning about $4 million apiece for fourth place.

 Just as nature abhors a vacuum, Manhattan abhors a dark, unused space where a restaurant recently existed. In fairly short order, one establishment's scratched lease and dashed ambitions become the next establishment's not-entirely-blank slate. Some furniture stays; some goes. A new menu and a new day dawn. 
 Or, in the case of the Blue Mill Tavern, which just opened where Grange Hall closed, an old day returns. 
 The Blue Mill Tavern resurrects the name of the restaurant that preceded Grange Hall and inhabited this space on Commerce Street in Greenwich Village for about five decades, beginning in the early 1940's. The Blue Mill reaches even further back than that with its décor, an extremely handsome composition of light-toned woods, mirrors and aluminum trim that evokes the Art Deco style of the 1930's. 
 This restaurant's nostalgic bent carries over to its menu, which offers $19 blue-plate specials: a designated entree plus soup (or salad) and dessert. On Mondays, that entree is liver and onions. On Thursdays, macaroni and cheese. On Sundays, meat loaf. 
 The Blue Mill does not take reservations, so several friends and I showed up before 7 P.M. last Friday, hoping that we would be early enough to snag one of the dining room's cozy booths. 
 That room was almost empty, but the bar area was almost full, so we lingered there. It has windows onto the West Village's charmingly narrow, leafy streets, and the mostly young, attractive crowd seemed to be unwinding from the work week rather than revving up for the social and sartorial challenges of the weekend. We noticed more beer bottles than martini glasses. We liked this. 
 After moving to a booth, we tried several salads and a rich, crunchy onion tart, all of which realized their modest ambitions. The roasted beets with goat cheese were precisely that. If the horseradish vinaigrette that moistened them was supposed to lift them to a higher level, it did not, but they were just fine at their own altitude. 
 I enjoyed the watercress with blue cheese and walnuts, but I felt as if I had enjoyed precisely the same salad many times before, and so I found myself channeling the spirit of Peggy Lee. Was that all there was? 
 No. We still had entrees and desserts to go. Seared sea scallops floated on a multi-colored, many-splendored tide of corn succotash and smoked bacon that proved to be a potent magnet for my spoon. But the ''crispy duck'' was not remotely crispy, and the overcooked prime rib tasted like pot roast. Desserts were a work in progress, from a dessert menu still undergoing changes. 
 As we left, I took a parting glance at the gorgeous cherry-wood bar, built around a three-feet-in-diameter, cast aluminum vintage clock from a French train station. I almost sat down again on one of the round stools for an after-dinner drink. But the meal and the evening belonged to the past. It was time to pick up with the future. 
 The Blue Mill Tavern, 50 Commerce Street, at Barrow Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 352-0009. Appetizers, $6 to $11; entrees, $14 to $24.

 An Atlantic City Dig 
 Ralph Hunter likes to go to yard sales. And Mr. Hunter, president of the African American Heritage Museum of Southern New Jersey in Newtonville, is always on the lookout for African-American collectibles. Last August he hit an unexpected jackpot in Atlantic City. Stopping at a house on Michigan Avenue, he learned that artwork had been stored in a crawlspace under the house some 60 years ago. But retrieving it would not be easy. The framed pieces, protected by glass, had sunk into the moist coastal soil. 
 But, undaunted, Mr. Hunter returned the next day in his coveralls with a flashlight and canvas gloves. Digging by hand, he unearthed nine charcoal sketches of African-Americans that appeared to be from the 1890's to the 1900's. Three portraits looked like the daughter, mother and granddaughter of the same family. There was also a portrait of a man in a morning suit and straw hat seated in a wingback chair and another of a smiling woman standing in front of a house, ''whose eyes looked right through me,'' said Mr. Hunter, who calls the day he dug up the pictures ''the second most exciting day of my life.'' 
 A collector of African-American memorabilia for 30 years, he founded the African-American museum two years ago; the core of the collection is the more than 3,000 objects he has collected. The newly discovered portraits provide rare depictions of Atlantic City's black bourgeoisie of that era, Mr. Hunter said. He plans to exhibit his new treasures after they are cleaned and restored.

 Ballet Rouge: ''Dracula'' 
 Not sated by Broadway's ''Dracula, the Musical''? Well, in Mercer County, you can try ''Dracula,'' the ballet. (Who knew that the wan Transylvanian count could dance?) The ballet will be performed by the Roxey Ballet Company Oct. 23 at 7 p.m. at the Villa Victoria Theater in Ewing. The title role will be danced in full bloodsucker regalia, including the requisite red-lined cape, by the ballet's artistic director, Mark Roxey, who was also its choreographer. ''The character requires a tremendous commitment,'' he said of Bram Stoker's toothy creation. ''It's not like the character has a moment to be weak.'' ''Dracula'' will also be performed for school groups Friday at 10 a.m. at the Villa Victoria Theater. The public is invited. Information: (609)397-7616 (ext. 807). 
 Hall-of-Fame Poet 
 Living near the Delaware and Raritan Canal keeps Paul Muldoon, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, in touch with his Irish roots. ''The canal is a point of contact in that it was built by Irishmen, kind of an Irish investment, as it were, in New Jersey,'' said Mr. Muldoon who has made his own investment in New Jersey, living just outside Princeton and teaching at the university. On Oct. 24 he will be inducted into the New Jersey Literary Hall of Fame along with the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David Levering Lewis; Mr. Lewis is the biographer of W.E.B. Du Bois and taught at Rutgers from 1985 to 2003. 
 ''Moy Sand and Gravel,'' the collection for which Mr. Muldoon received the 2003 Pulitzer Prize, holds many references to the Garden State. But was it hard for Mr. Muldoon to find his poetic path when he first came to America in 1988? Yes and no, he said. He knew the culture from watching television in Ireland, and though he found himself in a ''different language pool'' of English when he got here, he said, ''writers are people who are prepared to go slowly in a language.'' 
 Since he came here, he added, the thing that has struck him about the United States, ''is its variousness. There are several countries in it, even in New Jersey.'' 
 The New Jersey Literary Hall of Fame is a nonprofit group based at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark. The public induction ceremony will be at the Robert B. Meyner Reception Room of the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel from 1 to 4 p.m. For free tickets: (973)596-3276.

"438","Ford and G.M. Sales Slide Despite Generous Rebates",1631536,"|business",2,12,2004,"20041202T000000","|Linden (NJ)"," 
 Despite a crop of new car models and a still-generous supply of rebates, sales fell for the Ford Motor Company and General Motors in November. 
 Both companies said they would cut production in the first quarter of 2005 from levels of the same quarter this year, the latest troubling sign for job growth in Michigan and other states where the companies operate. G.M. said Tuesday that it was accelerating a plan to stop production at a plant in Linden, N.J., and would lay off nearly 1,000 workers at the plant early next year. 
 A Ford executive also said Wednesday that high gas prices were beginning to affect the perceptions of buyers -- a controversial notion in Detroit, which has long leaned heavily for profits on large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. 
 ''We've been up around $2 for a while now,'' Phil Martens, Ford's vice president for product creation, said of gasoline prices. He added that the company's recent polling data showed that the prices were ''creeping into people's consciousness.'' 
 Gary Dilts, the chief industry sales analyst at the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler, disagreed, saying, ''it's not hitting the radar here.'' 
 Jason Vines, the chief spokesman for Chrysler, added that ''historically, higher gas prices impact lower-income families who have a tendency to drive used vehicles anyway. It's not the new vehicle purchasers.'' 
 Overall auto sales across the industry have been robust this year, but cooled off last month, declining 4.9 percent, or about 1 percent when adjusted for the same number of selling days as November 2003, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. 
 G.M. and Ford have long been struggling to hold onto customers as Toyota and other foreign competitors take more of the market. Now they also face a reinvigorated Chrysler, lifted by its relatively new vehicle lineup, particularly the 300 Series sedan, a car with an expansive grille that has been a rare attention-getter among domestic cars. Sales at DaimlerChrysler, which includes Mercedes, rose 8.8 percent in November, according to Wards. 
 Sales were down 13.2 percent at G.M., which has recently introduced several new passenger cars but is saddled with an aging lineup of large pickup trucks and large sport utility vehicles. The company has been spending more on rebates and low-rate financing deals than any other automaker, but moderated its deals somewhat last month. Its latest promotion, called Lock 'n' Roll, which promised many buyers the chance to lock in low interest rates for two consecutive vehicle purchases, had a limited effect on sales. 
 One financial analyst, Ronald Tadross of Bank of America, questioned the company's approach during a conference call held by G.M. on Wednesday. 
 ''Your sales are worse than expected, but you're not doing anything about that,'' Mr. Tadross said. ''You're not cutting your prices, the production cut in the first quarter is at the low end of the range I expected. What's your strategy?'' 
 Paul Ballew, G.M.'s chief industry sales analyst, said, ''You have to come out with best-in-class products, you have to make sure you're developing best-in-class brands, continue to cut costs and remain aggressive'' in offering incentives. 
 ''The marketplace right now is pretty unforgiving and we're in there slogging it out,'' Mr. Ballew added. 
 All of G.M.'s brands, except for its Isuzu affiliate, posted declines last month. Buick and Pontiac were hardest hit, with sales down 33.5 and 31.4 percent. 
 Ford sales fell 4 percent in November, with sales gains by two of the company's European brands, Volvo and Land Rover, helping to offset losses at the Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands. 
 Results for several crucial Ford and G.M. models are still too early to judge, since they only recently made their debuts. G.M. sold about 4,400 Pontiac G6 sedans last month, about half of the volume it hoped to eventually sell of the car that was to replace the Grand Am. Ford's Freestyle wagon and Five Hundred sedan are also new to the market; the company's redesigned Mustang has been a clear early bright spot. 
 Ford said it would cut its first quarter North American production by nearly 8 percent, to 930,000 vehicles. G.M. said its initial first-quarter production forecast of 1.25 million cars and trucks was down 7.1 percent from a year earlier. Next month, G.M. is expected to try to vault its Chevrolet brand past the Ford brand as the nation's top-selling line. 
 Toyota sales of all models rose 8.8 percent in November, according to Ward's, while Nissan had a particularly strong month, with sales of all models up 31 percent. 
 Not all Asian automakers are prospering. Mitsubishi continues to be in a freefall after a string of scandals and lagging product development. Sales fell nearly 51 percent last month. The company's latest executive departure came late last month as Ian Beavis, the company's United States marketing chief, left after just a year on the job."

"440","States and Cities Must Hunt Terror Plots, Governor Says",1634927,"|u.s.",15,12,2004,"20041215T000000",NA," 
 To protect America against terrorists, state and local agencies, as well as private businesses, need to gather intelligence themselves and not just rely on intelligence gathered by the federal government, Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, the leader of a national working group on safeguarding the nation, told homeland security officials on Tuesday. 
 ''The eyes and ears which gather intelligence need to be as developed in our country as they were in foreign countries during the cold war,'' Mr. Romney told the group. ''Meter readers, E.M.S. drivers, law enforcement, private sector personnel need to be on the lookout for information which may be as useful.'' 
 In a presentation by telephone to Tom Ridge, the secretary of homeland security, and members of the Homeland Security Advisory Council, who were meeting in San Diego, Mr. Romney said that local law enforcement agencies should stop believing that they could protect all possible targets of terrorism. 
 ''We could increase our law enforcement personnel tenfold, but we can't protect every target,'' Mr. Romney said. ''There are just too many schools, churches, stadiums, bridges, tunnels, roads, subways. We have to be able to find the bad guys before they carry out their acts, and that can only be done through intelligence. The financial resources of our nation and our states should be increasingly devoted to this effort.'' 
 The proposal by Mr. Romney's working group represents a new and more assertive role for many local law enforcement agencies and other public and private entities in fighting terrorism, some experts on domestic security said. 
 Some cities and states, including Massachusetts, Colorado and Los Angeles, have set up or are planning ''fusion centers,'' which collect information from local sources and seek to analyze it and draw conclusions. New York City goes beyond that, sending detectives to places like Israel and Singapore, as well as to other states to investigate businesses that sell explosives. 
 But under Mr. Romney's proposal, every state would be urged to marshal local agencies and businesses, with the goal of collecting details and observations that might, when stitched together, point to a potential terrorist attack. 
 ''If you have a transit system that circles a major city and you get reports of people photographing trains at various locations, well, the report from one police station may be meaningless, but several of them may be a pattern,'' said John D. Cohen, senior homeland security policy adviser to Massachusetts. 
 The proposal ''makes a great deal of sense to me,'' said Dave McIntyre, who teaches about domestic security at Texas A&M University. ''I don't see how you're going to protect every high school football stadium, every school bus, every theater. I do think that we might find that a better investment of resources is to look at intelligence and investigative development.'' 
 Mr. Romney, who dealt with post-9/11 security issues as president of the organizing committee for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, said in an interview on Monday that his involvement with the domestic security working group was an outgrowth of the concern he felt as governor about the way the federal government was transmitting information and the lack of direction that the federal government was giving the states. 
 ''I was initially quite frustrated that the homeland security money came without any sense of what states should do,'' Mr. Romney said, saying that when he raised those concerns, he was asked to assemble and lead a working group on the subject. 
 Mr. Romney, who is often mentioned as a Republican with potential or ambition to occupy a national office, insisted in the interview that he had no desire to be the next director of homeland security, or to take any other position in the Bush administration. He said that after the November elections, he told Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, ''in case my name gets bandied about for any position, I'm filling my entire term'' as governor, which expires in two years. 
 Dr. McIntyre said a potential pitfall of the working group's proposal was the issue of making sure that local agencies and businesses did not violate civil liberties. ''How do we properly ensure that we're investigating some Americans without investigating all Americans?'' he asked. 
 Mr. Cohen, the security adviser, said: ''When we're talking about engaging frontline personnel, we're not asking them to go out and spy on people. In the course of them doing their jobs day to day, they collect information. And we're talking about teaching people to be more sensitive when information that is collected in the course of their day-to-day business may actually have a nexus with terrorism.'' 
 At Tuesday's meeting in San Diego, with Mr. Romney presenting his report from Boston, Mr. Ridge asked about the cost of the working group's plan. Mr. Romney, whose group included state and local officials and business executives from around the country, said some of the money for training local officials and setting up fusion centers could come from federal homeland security grants to states. 
 But, he added: ''Whether I'm going to get funding from the federal government or not, this is a priority and I'm going to go after this. I went to the Legislature this year to get funding for our fusion center.'' 
 Mr. Romney said the intelligence that states received from the federal government was ''oftentimes confusing'' and sometimes contradictory. His report recommended that information be disseminated through a single federal agency. 
 Mr. Romney's report also said that too much information from the federal agencies was classified as secret or top secret, barring state officials from giving details to most local officials, who do not have adequate security clearance. 
 ''You're put in a position of not passing it on or passing it on to someone without the right clearance and violating the law,'' Mr. Cohen said."

 WHEN a court-appointed panel made its recommendation on school financing three weeks ago, it was as if New York City schools had hit the jackpot. The panel reported that an additional $5.6 billion should be spent on city schools each year and that $9.2 billion worth of new classrooms, laboratories, libraries and other facilities were needed to provide what a judge has ruled was the state's constitutional obligation to provide ''a sound, basic education.'' 
 The recommendation was a major victory for the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, the advocacy group that sued the state a decade ago on behalf of the city's public school students. 
 But there was no joy in the suburbs. Though no decision has been made about where the extra billions would come from, many experts agree that a sizable chunk of it would have to come from Nassau and Suffolk Counties. 
 Long Island residents already pay some of the highest property taxes in the country, and now, anticipating a statewide review of school aid policy, some local officials and advocates are making the case that Long Island should not be subsidizing other parts of the state. 
 ''I think that Nassau County is somehow getting shortchanged on school aid,'' said Howard Weitzman, the county comptroller. He said he had been studying Nassau County as well as Suffolk and New York City's northern suburbs for a report that he plans to send in the next few days to local and state lawmakers. 
 According to the report, Nassau County school districts in 2001-2 spent an average of $16,838 per student, with 16.6 percent of revenues coming from the state. Suffolk County, the report says, spent $15,997 per student and relied on the state for about 20 percent of school financing. 
 New York City spent $12,169 per student, with 43.3 percent of revenues from the state, well above the state average, 37.4 percent. 
 Mitchell H. Pally, the vice president for government affairs at the Long Island Association, said Long Island residents had long been making up for shortfalls in state aid to their own schools by increasing local taxes. But the city has not been making up the difference, he said, and Long Island should not be penalized for doing what New York should have been doing all along. 
 ''The inadequacy of the funding is not based on the fact that New York State does not give them enough money,'' he said. ''It's based on the fact that New York City doesn't give their own schools enough money.'' 
 The Long Island Association calculated that if all the $5.6 billion were financed by city residents, the percentage of income that they would pay in local taxes would end up only slightly greater than the percentage Long Island residents pay now. 
 City officials want the state to pick up the cost of the panel's recommendation, arguing that inadequate school financing is not the city's fault. 
 ''It's not just that we educate 38 percent of the kids and we only get 34 percent of the total dollar figure,"" said Eva Moskowitz, a councilwoman in Manhattan. ''We also have a student population that has many more educational needs.'' City pupils are more likely to live in poverty, lack prekindergarten schooling or be learning English, she said. 
 The panel's recommendation said the city's burden could not be ''arbitrary or unreasonable,'' but the battle has already started over what unreasonable means. Governor Pataki has suggested that the city contribute 40 percent, and some, like Steven Sanders of Manhattan, the head of the State Assembly's Education Committee, have said that 25 percent is a reasonable compromise. 
 But Edmund J. McMahon of the Manhattan Institute said that ultimately any solution would be costly to Long Island. 
 ''Any set of circumstances that is putting more fiscal pressure on the state of New York and even on the city of New York ultimately is bad news for Long Island,'' said. 
 Even if the state pays only 60 percent of the $5.6 billion, that still means a yearly state layout of almost $3.4 billion. In one likely scenario, Mr. McMahon said, legislators would demand that their districts' proportions of aid remain the same. 
 With New York City receiving about a third of the state's aid to public schools, this would mean that the entire state aid budget would increase by around $8 billion. Paying for that would require tax increases, Mr. McMahon said, and higher income taxes will hit hard on Long Island, with its disproportionate share of above-average incomes. 
 On the other hand, the state might decide to rearrange the proportions, forcing wealthier school districts to make up for lost state aid with higher property taxes. That would also affect Long Island residents, whose property values are higher than the state average. 
 Anticipating the panel's recommendation, the Citizens Budget Commission issued a report in November exploring other options for financing, like taxing gambling receipts, broadening the state sales tax to cover more goods and services and eliminating waste. But all these measures taken together would probably not prevent some form of tax increase, the report said. 
 A formula devised by the commission found that, if the entire $5.6 billion were financed solely by an increase in the state sales tax, the tax would jump to 6.8 percent from the current 4 percent. If it were financed solely by an income tax increase, a family with an income of around $60,000 would pay about $685 more a year. 
 ''It's inevitably going to involve redistribution,'' said Charles Brecher, a research director at the commission. 
 But Michael A. Rebell, executive director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, said he was working to make sure no district received less financing than it was receiving now. 
 He said that the New York City shortfall was only part of the bigger picture, which includes needy Long Island districts like Brentwood, Roosevelt and Wyandanch. A study by Mr. Rebell's organization and allied groups lists 517 of the state's 698 school districts, 41 of them on Long Island, as inadequately financed. 
 On Monday, Mr. Rebell met in Albany with education advocates, policy makers and school officials from around the state to work on legislation that would commit $8.5 billion more annually to schools statewide. 
 The financial discrepancy Long Island from district to district is why Mr. Brecher said it was impossible to make simple conclusions about the impact of the panel's recommendation. 
 Wealthy districts like Great Neck can have high tax revenues per student without high tax rates because much of the property in the district is so expensive and there is a significant commercial base. As a result, Great Neck received only 11 percent of its revenue in state aid, according to a Citizens' Budget Commission report for the 2001-2 school year. 
 Poorer districts with small commercial districts, like Roosevelt, are in a double bind, with higher-than-average tax rates but below-average tax revenues per student. Even though state aid made up 64 percent of Roosevelt's revenues, the Campaign for Fiscal Equity said the district needed a 40 percent increase in financing to reach adequate levels. 
 ''I think there's a general demand that the problems are not limited to New York City in terms of funding,'' said Thomas P. DiNapoli of Thomaston, the leader of the Island's delegation in the State Assembly. ''The worst result would be a New York City-only solution. I tend to think it won't come to that, but who knows?'' 
 Correction:  December 26, 2004, Sunday  An article on Dec. 19 about Long Island school districts' concerns over a proposed reformulation of state aid to education misstated the Nassau County comptroller's calculation of state aid as a percentage of Suffolk public schools' revenues. It is 29.8 percent, not 20 percent."

 Dvorak: Violin Concerto, Piano Trio in F minor 
 Isabelle Faust, violinist; Jean-Guihen Queyras, cellist; Alexander Melnikov, pianist; Prague Philharmonia, conducted by Jiri Belohlavek. Harmonia Mundi France HMC 901833; CD. 
 THE Dvorak anniversary year is officially over, but the tributes keep rolling in like birthday calls from forgetful relatives. 
 One noteworthy new disc comes from the talented young German violinist Isabelle Faust. Ms. Faust has built her career primarily in Europe, but she is slowly becoming known in this country through a series of impressive recordings that have shown her to be a thoughtful and dynamic interpreter of 20th-century repertory, from Bartok to Szymanowski and Lutoslawski. Her insights and fiery commitment in that music have announced her as a fresh voice with something compelling to say. 
 Ms. Faust continues in that vein with this recording, though she has now ventured into the land of big concertos, where she inevitably encounters much more competition. Dvorak's Violin Concerto hardly receives the attention of his towering Cello Concerto, but this meaty Brahmsian work has been turning up recently with increasing frequency in the concert hall and on disc. 
 Ms. Faust gives a resonant and impassioned account that can easily hold its own next to recent efforts from her better-known peers. The first movement draws you in with its expressive urgency, the slow movement's finely drawn lines avoid the pitfalls of oversentimentality, and the finale has a bright ardency and tight rhythmic flair. The Prague Philharmonia under Jiri Belohlavek gives Ms. Faust warm and well-proportioned support. 
 Complementing the concerto is a heated account of Dvorak's darker F minor Piano Trio, showing Ms. Faust to be not only a fine soloist but also a capable ensemble leader. You have to hope, however, that such a mainstream disc does not mark a turn away from her earlier commitment to exploring less-trafficked corridors of the repertory.

"444","Greed Drove Abuse Claims, Lawyer for Jackson Says",1653829,"|u.s.",2,3,2005,"20050302T000000",NA," 
 Michael Jackson came to suspect the motives of the family of the boy who later accused him of sexual misconduct, and banished them from his Neverland ranch and stopped giving them expensive gifts, Mr. Jackson's lawyer said on Tuesday. 
 The mother of the boy saw Mr. Jackson as a benefactor who would buy her a house, pay for college for her children and support her for the rest of her life, said Mr. Jackson's lead lawyer, Thomas A. Mesereau Jr., who made the charges in his opening statement, which he concluded Tuesday morning. 
 But when Mr. Jackson grew suspicious and cut the family off, the mother retaliated by consulting a lawyer and concocting a story of sexual abuse of her son, a cancer survivor who was 13 years old at the time of the alleged incidents, Mr. Mesereau said. 
 ''When she realized that she couldn't make millions of dollars one way, she looked for another way, and here we are,'' Mr. Mesereau said. He said the mother had numerous contacts with law enforcement and child welfare officials immediately after the alleged abuse occurred, and never reported it. 
 ''Mr. Jackson flat-out denies these allegations,'' Mr. Mesereau said. ''They are false.'' 
 Mr. Mesereau has made it clear that he intends to question aggressively the credibility and the motives of the accuser's mother. He has portrayed her as a serial liar who has tried to extort money from celebrities by using her son's cancer as a hook. Mr. Jackson was her chief prey, Mr. Mesereau said. 
 Mr. Mesereau at one point raised the possibility that Mr. Jackson would take the stand. 
 ''Michael will tell you one time he got a very bad feeling at Neverland,'' Mr. Mesereau said, referring to his suspicions about the accuser's family. He also said Mr. Jackson ''will freely admit that he does read girlie magazines from time to time.'' 
 Putting Mr. Jackson on the stand could be risky for the defense because it would subject him to cross-examination. Mr. Jackson is not on the list of 370 witnesses provided by the defense before the start of the trial. A spokeswoman for Mr. Jackson said Tuesday that his lawyers had not decided whether to call him. 
 Mr. Mesereau also directly addressed charges by prosecutors that Mr. Jackson had provided alcohol to the accuser as a prelude to sexually molesting him. He denied that vehemently but said the boy and his younger brother had broken into liquor supplies at Neverland on several occasions and had been caught drunk by household staff members. He said the accuser and his brother and sister had memorized security codes in the house and figured out how to operate the carnival rides on the property. He said the children threw objects from the top of a Ferris wheel onto one of Mr. Jackson's elephants. The children, Mr. Mesereau said, were out of control. 
 He also denied accusations that Mr. Jackson had shown the children pornographic magazines, saying that they found them on their own and that Mr. Jackson snatched the magazines away and locked them up. 
 And he said that investigators did not find any DNA from the accuser in Mr. Jackson's bedroom, where prosecutors say he molested the boy. 
 After Mr. Mesereau finished his presentation, the prosecution showed the jury the two-hour documentary, ''Living With Michael Jackson.'' 
 The program includes scenes of the accuser with Mr. Jackson and Mr. Jackson defending his practice of sharing his bed with children. The documentary touched off panic in the Jackson camp because of the admissions about sleeping with children, prosecutors said, and led to a conspiracy to imprison and silence the accuser's family. 
 At one point during the showing of the documentary, when Mr. Jackson was talking about his love for children, the singer appeared to dab at his eyes with a tissue. At another point, when archival footage of him performing with the Jackson 5 as a young boy appeared on the screen, his mother, Katherine, smiled, and his older brother Jackie, nodded his head along with the music. 
 The prosecution's first witness was the British journalist who made the Jackson documentary, Martin Bashir. 
 The chief prosecutor, District Attorney Thomas W. Sneddon Jr. of Santa Barbara County, asked Mr. Bashir a few questions about his background and qualifications before the tape was shown. 
 But at the conclusion, Mr. Bashir came under hostile cross-examination from Mr. Mesereau, who sought to have the documentary and most of Mr. Bashir's testimony stricken from the record because Mr. Bashir refused to answer questions about how he obtained Mr. Jackson's cooperation in the project. His questions suggested that Mr. Bashir had misrepresented himself and tricked Mr. Jackson into participating. 
 Mr. Bashir's lawyer, Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., objected repeatedly to Mr. Mesereau's questions, saying that journalists do not have to testify about unpublished material, citing both California's journalist shield law and the First Amendment. The judge in the case, Rodney S. Melville of Santa Barbara County Superior Court, instructed Mr. Bashir to answer. He refused. 
 Judge Melville said he and the lawyers had waded into a ''really ticklish area of the law'' and said he would rule later on what legal protections might apply to Mr. Bashir. 
 As he left the courtroom, Mr. Jackson was asked how he felt. ''Good,'' he replied, then turned a moment later to say, ''Angry.''"
"445","Rigidity, Floppiness And Doubt",1657849,"|movies|arts",18,3,2005,"20050318T000000",NA," 
 Disquiet pervaded Dance Theater Workshop Wednesday night, in works by Mollie O'Brien and the choreographic team known as robbinschilds (Sonya Robbins and Layla Childs). 
 Ms. O'Brien's ''This is what I would have felt,'' choreographed in collaboration with members of her company, MOB Productions, began with Jennifer Dignan methodically picking up squares of white tissue from the stage. Gina Jacobs entered, nervously tugging at her hair and rubbing her legs. Kate Garroway and Donna Costello followed her in choreography that marked contrasting states of rigidity and floppiness to a melancholy score by Shawn Onsgard for Alex Weinstein, a guitarist, and Ken Thomson, on clarinet and saxophone. 
 The characters often seemed befuddled. At other times, they swung their arms compulsively. The four women appeared anxious and, possibly, ill. They scrutinized each other as if conducting medical examinations, muttered incomprehensibly and burst into inexplicable tears. The work ended with pieces of tissue raining down upon the stage. 
 Something obviously ailed these women. But the audience never learned what it was. Nor did the choreography allow any of the dancers to disclose their troubles to anyone else. Instead, the dance communicated how difficult it is for people to communicate. And it communicated that message quite effectively. But because it did, you wished Ms. O'Brien might go on and communicate something more. 
 Other mystifications filled ''half space,'' by robbinschilds, to a sonic collage by Dan Crane and Rosten Woo. The space was dominated by a glittering chandelier, a mountain of rugs and a stack of piled-up chairs. Michael Helland unrolled rugs with his feet. Ms. Childs and Ms. Robbins rolled around the stage like human rugs, never rising from the floor. Leslie Kraus danced an abrupt duet with Mr. Helland that ended with him hoisting her atop the chairs. There was a more languid duet for Rachael Faulkner and Mr. Helland, and a trio of forced jollity for all three of those dancers. 
 But for all this movement, their exertions accomplished little dramatically. 
 The performance continues through tomorrow night at Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)924-0077.

"446","U.S. Helped to Prepare the Way for Kyrgyzstan's Uprising",1660925,"|world|washington",30,3,2005,"20050330T000000","|Kyrgyzstan|Norway|Netherlands|Great Britain|Kyrgyzstan|United States|Europe"," 
 Shortly before Kyrgyzstan's recent parliamentary elections, an opposition newspaper ran photographs of a palatial home under construction for the country's deeply unpopular president, Askar Akayev, helping set off widespread outrage and a popular revolt in this poor Central Asian country. 
 The newspaper was the recipient of United States government grants and was printed on an American government-financed printing press operated by Freedom House, an American organization that describes itself as ''a clear voice for democracy and freedom around the world.'' 
 In addition to the United States, several European countries -- Britain, the Netherlands and Norway among them -- have helped underwrite programs to develop democracy and civil society in this country. The effort played a crucial role in preparing the ground for the popular uprising that swept opposition politicians to power. 
 ''Of course, this infrastructure had an influence,'' said one European election observer. ''People now believe they have rights, and they were not scared because the repressive capacity of the system was weak.'' 
 After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kyrgyzstan quickly became an aid magnet with the highest per-capita foreign assistance level of any Central Asian nation. Among the hundreds of millions of dollars that arrived came a large slice focused on building up civil society and democratic institutions. 
 Most of that money came from the United States, which maintains the largest bilateral pro-democracy program in Kyrgyzstan because of the Freedom Support Act, passed by Congress in 1992 to help the former Soviet republics in their economic and democratic transitions. The money earmarked for democracy programs in Kyrgyzstan totaled about $12 million last year. 
 Hundreds of thousands more filter into pro-democracy programs in the country from other United States government-financed institutions like the National Endowment for Democracy. That does not include the money for the Freedom House printing press or Kyrgyz-language service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a pro-democracy broadcaster. 
 ''It would have been absolutely impossible for this to have happened without that help,'' said Edil Baisolov, who leads a coalition of nongovernmental organizations, referring to the uprising last week. Mr. Baisolov's organization is financed by the United States government through the National Democratic Institute. 
 American money helps finance civil society centers around the country where activists and citizens can meet, receive training, read independent newspapers and even watch CNN or surf the Internet in some. The N.D.I. alone operates 20 centers that provide news summaries in Russian, Kyrgyz and Uzbek. 
 The United States sponsors the American University in Kyrgyzstan, whose stated mission is, in part, to promote the development of civil society, and pays for exchange programs that send students and non-governmental organization leaders to the United States. Kyrgyzstan's new prime minister, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, was one. 
 All of that money and manpower gave the coalescing Kyrgyz opposition financing and moral support in recent years, as well as the infrastructure that allowed it to communicate its ideas to the Kyrgyz people. 
 The growing civil society, meanwhile, began to have an awakening effect on the country's population just as Mr. Akayev and his family grew increasingly enamored of their power. ''If none of this had been here, the family would have remained in power and people probably would have remained passive, as they have in other Central Asian countries,'' said Jeffrey Lilley, who runs the local office of the International Republican Institute, a United States-financed pro-democracy organization. 
 Alexander Kim, editor in chief of the opposition newspaper that printed the photos of the president's house, knows the problem well: in 1999, Mr. Akayev's son-in-law took control of Mr. Kim's first newspaper, which he and other employees had bought from the state during the privatizations earlier that decade. 
 He says the son-in-law used fraudulent means, but he was never able to prove it in court. So Mr. Kim went on to found another newspaper, which went through several incarnations as the government tried to prevent him from publishing. He has been helped by about $70,000 in American government grants, mostly to pay for newsprint. 
 The problem, though, was finding a press: they were all controlled by the government and refused to print newspapers from the opposition. 
 Then Mike Stone, Freedom House's representative in Kyrgyzstan, arrived. 
 ''When Freedom House opened their printing press, it was the end of our problems,'' Mr. Kim said. 
 By January this year, Mr. Kim had begun national distribution of the newspaper, called MSN, for My Capital News. Opposition candidates in the parliamentary elections bought truckloads of the papers to distribute as campaign literature. 
 Those Kyrgyz who did not read Russian or have access to the newspaper listened to summaries of its articles on Kyrgyz-language Radio Azattyk, the local United States-government financed franchise of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. 
 Other independent media carried the opposition's debates. Talk shows, like ''Our Times,'' produced in part with United States government grants, were broadcast over the country's few independent television stations, including Osh TV in the south, where the protests that led to Mr. Akayev's ouster began. Osh TV expanded its reach with equipment paid for by the State Department. 
 ''The result is that the society became politicized, they were informed,'' Mr. Kim said. ''The role of the NGO's and independent media were crucial factors in the revolution.'' 
 As corruption grew worse, the country's nongovernmental organizations began speaking out, and Mr. Akayev grew wary of the foreign pro-democracy assistance he had long allowed. 
 The published pictures of his house outraged him. Mr. Stone, who runs the printing press, was summoned to the Foreign Ministry and berated. 
 A week later, just before the press began printing a 200,000-copy special issue of MSN, the power at the press went out. Radio Liberty was also taken off the air, ostensibly because the government was putting its frequency up for auction. 
 Mr. Akayev began suggesting that the West was engaged in a conspiracy to destabilize the country. A crudely forged document, made to look like an internal report by the American ambassador, Stephen Young, began circulating among local news organizations. It cast American-financed pro-democracy activities as part of an American conspiracy. ''Our primary goal,'' the document read, ''is to increase pressure upon Akaev (sic) to make him resign ahead of schedule after the parliamentary elections.'' 
 But Mr. Akayev, who had begun his presidential career as an advocate of democracy, did not go further. 
 The American Embassy sent Freedom House two generators the day after the power went out, allowing the press to print nearly all of the 200,000 copies of MSN's special issue. The power was restored on March 8, and Mr. Kim's newspaper became one of the primary sources of information for the mobilizing opposition. 
 MSN informed people in the north of the unrest in the south. The newspaper also played a critical role in disseminating word of when and where protesters should gather. 
 ''There was fertile soil here, and the Western community planted some seeds,'' said one Western official. ''I'm hoping these events of the past week will be one of those moments when you see the fruits of your labors.''"
"447","To Make Money From a Bank, Buy the Bank's Buildings",1666276,"|business",20,4,2005,"20050420T000000",NA," 
 In 1998, Nicholas S. Schorsch was operating a cemetery and several other enterprises when the bank he did business with, the CoreStates Financial Corporation, was bought by the First Union Corporation for $19.7 billion. Because of the merger, 105 branch banks were set to close, and Mr. Schorsch sensed an opportunity. 
 To CoreStates' astonishment, Mr. Schorsch offered to buy the buildings -- en masse. ''They thought I was a crazy man,'' he recalled recently in an interview at his company's headquarters in this Philadelphia suburb. ''Nobody buys 100 bank branches in one day.'' 
 The $22.3 million deal was completed in about a month, Mr. Schorsch said, and within a year, all but a handful of the vacant buildings had been leased or sold. ''Our seemingly erratic bet turned out to be a wonderful business,'' he said. 
 But it might have remained a relatively small business if Mr. Schorsch had not been introduced to Lewis S. Ranieri, the former Salomon Brothers trader who has been called the father of the securitized mortgage industry. It happened that Mr. Ranieri had been talking to an investment banking company, Friedman Billings Ramsey, about creating a publicly traded company that would acquire property only from financial institutions. 
 Mr. Schorsch and Mr. Ranieri teamed up, raising $378.9 million from private investors in 2002 and going public the next year. Today, the company, American Financial Realty Trust, is among the most prominent players on a growing list of real estate investment trusts that specialize in niches of the market. Typically, these companies acquire property within their niches and sign long-term leases with tenants -- often the previous owners -- who occupy the entire building and are responsible for its maintenance. 
 The only REIT specializing in financial institutions, American Financial has announced $250 million worth of transactions just this quarter and is now a $4.4 billion business. The company owns 959 properties with 32.7 million square feet of space in 33 states and the District of Columbia. Bank of America is the company's biggest tenant by far, accounting for 46.8 percent of the rentable square feet as of Dec. 31. But though it has yet to win the confidence of Wall Street, American Financial is catching on with a growing number of financial institutions. 
 What makes American Financial unusual is its willingness to buy not just bank branches but an entire portfolio, including office buildings and data and call centers, real estate specialists say. The company buys in bulk at prices that are based on each building's appraised value minus a discount, which ranges from 4.5 percent to 10 percent, said Mr. Schorsch, the chief executive. 
 So, for example, American Financial will buy nearly all of the 174 bank branches -- minus only those found to have environmental or structural problems -- that the Wachovia Corporation plans to close in the Southeast as part of its merger with the SouthTrust Corporation. 
 This type of one-stop shopping is very appealing to financial institutions, real estate specialists say. ''Real estate is just incidental to their business,'' said James S. Corl, the chief investment officer for real estate at Cohen & Steers, a company that invests in American Financial. ''Disposing of the excess in one fell swoop is very helpful to them.'' 
 Sometimes, the banks will sell office buildings that they partially occupy to American Financial and rent just the space they need. ''The main benefit to us is it transfers the risk of leasing that vacant space from us to A.F.R.T.,'' said Robert F. Bertges, director of corporate real estate for the Wachovia Corporation, American Financial's third-largest bank tenant. 
 Being able to delete vacant or underperforming property from a balance sheet is especially desirable in the wake of new accounting rules that require companies to carry their properties at market value rather than depreciated value, said Srikanth Nagarajan, an analyst at UBS. 
 An energetic man who is quick to jump up from his seat to illustrate a point by drawing a diagram on a board, Mr. Schorsch, 44, said that when he first began buying empty bank branches, he expected to re-lease them to drugstores and fast-food restaurants rather than other banks. He had assumed that as the banking industry consolidated further and online banking became more widely accepted, the number of bank branches would diminish. 
 But it turned out that bank branches were actually proliferating. From 1994 through 2003, the number of commercial banks and savings institutions declined by 29 percent, but the number of bank branches increased by 15 percent, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. And the trend is continuing. From June 2003 to June 2004, the number of F.D.I.C.-insured institutions declined by 194, to 9,066, while the number of branches rose by 1,594, to 89,814. ''The single most important factor influencing a customer's choice of banks is the location of the institution's branches,'' the F.D.I.C. said in a report issued last year. 
 Customers need personal contact because banks provide so many services other than check cashing, Mr. Bertges said. 
 Mr. Schorsch said that regional banks, in particular, were often eager to lease space that previously belonged to another bank and avoid the expense of installing vaults and the pneumatic equipment used in drive-through branches for transferring money. In cases where the seller does not want to see a competitor move into a shuttered branch building, American Financial either sells the building or leases it to a retailer like Krispy Kreme or Starbucks, he said. 
 Skepticism about whether empty bank buildings will always attract new tenants is one reason Wall Street has been slow to embrace American Financial, analysts say. From the outset, when the company's principal tenant, Bank of America, helped to underwrite its public offering, the company has drawn criticism. 
 Mr. Schorsch's rich compensation ($3.2 million in salary, bonuses and stock in 2003, according to a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission) has been questioned, although some people say it is not out of line. ''He definitely has a higher-than-average compensation package,'' said Damon J. Andres, a senior portfolio manager for Delaware Investments, an investment management firm in Philadelphia, which is among American Financial's top 20 shareholders. ''But it's on the high end of reasonable.'' 
 Some analysts are uneasy about the company because its business, while geographically diverse, depends on just a few banks, with its top 10 tenants accounting for 86.1 percent of its rent rolls. Critics wonder whether American Financial can add value to the buildings that it acquires because its leases are long term (the average is 14.7 years), with only small increases along the way. 
 Mr. Schorsch said, however, that while many investors are buying much riskier buildings today with an initial rate of return of only 5 percent or 6 percent, his decidedly less glamorous acquisitions produce higher returns from the outset and offer greater stability. ''We do boring well,'' he said. 
 Eyebrows were raised last year, however, when American Financial bought the State Street Financial Center in downtown Boston for $706.9 million, twice what it had cost to build the 36-story tower, which was completed in 2003. Many real estate specialists wondered if the company had changed its business plan and was becoming an office REIT. But the building was fully occupied by the State Street Corporation, which had a 20-year lease with annual increases. ''So while the buildings seemed expensive,'' said David Fick, a managing director at Legg Mason Wood Walker, ''when you consider the cash-flow stream, it actually financially made sense.'' 
 But Mr. Fick said that office buildings represented a disproportionate portion of American Financial's square footage. ''Going forward, we expect to see more bank branches and less office,'' he said. And indeed, branches represented 13 percent of its rentable space by end of last year, up from 10 percent the year before -- a trend that Mr. Ranieri said was likely to continue. 
 ''Now we're buying mostly branches,'' he said. ''We will eventually wind up where we said we would be, in terms of the balance of the portfolio.'' 
 Citing a favorite adage, Mr. Ranieri said he was not surprised that American Financial often found itself under attack. ''You can always tell the pioneers, because they are the ones with the arrows in their back,'' he said. ''When you describe the venture, it takes a while for people to understand it. It's not unusual when you create new things.''

"448","Boy, 13, Dies After Dispute Over Life Support Is Settled",1668502,"|health|new york|region",29,4,2005,"20050429T000000",NA," 
 Teron Francis, the 13-year-old Bronx boy who slipped into a mysterious coma about nine days ago, died yesterday after his parents asked doctors at a Bronx hospital to turn off his respirator. His death ended a bitter feud between the family's lawyers and officials of the Montefiore Medical Center over his care there. 
 A spokesman for the medical center, Steven Osborne, said that the ventilator that had sustained Teron's organs was turned off at the request of his family, and that his heart stopped beating at 5:05 p.m. 
 ''Our hearts go out to the family, and we hope they will be able to find peace,'' Mr. Osborne said. 
 Speaking on behalf of Teron's mother, Marcerlyn Francis, Robert Genis, a lawyer, said: ''Heaven has another angel tonight, so when you look up in the sky and see the stars, that's Teron.'' 
 The arguments over Teron's treatment were marked by what both sides called miscommunications. Lawyers for the Francis family said that their clients felt mistreated by hospital officials, particularly when two doctors told family members that Teron would be taken off life support without their consent, an assertion the hospital denies. 
 ''The family had difficulty reaching out and communicating after that,'' Mr. Genis said. 
 Montefiore's medical director, Gary Kalkut, said that Mr. Genis's involvement had disrupted the normal course of counseling between doctors, social workers and grieving family members. 
 Some of the dispute seemed to hinge on language, which was reminiscent of the case of Terri Schiavo, the Florida woman who was removed from life support last month after a prolonged and bitter legal fight between her parents and her husband and their respective allies. 
 Hospital officials said they used accurate medical terminology to describe Teron's state. They shied away from using the term ''life support,'' for example, and maintained that the boy was dead -- not ''brain dead'' -- because he had no brain function. Mr. Genis said that language contributed to an atmosphere of mistrust on the part of the family. 
 ''The Schiavo case is the backdrop, but it is important to understand the differences between the two cases,'' Dr. Kalkut said. ''Teron Francis was dead and it wasn't a question of whether he was responding or not.'' He accused Mr. Genis of conflating Teron's case with Terri Schiavo's. 
 Teron was sent to Montefiore on April 19 at the request of Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, where he was first taken after he fell ill, Dr. Kalkut said. Doctors at Montefiore suspected then that he was brain-dead, Dr. Kalkut said, and when tests over the next two days confirmed that suspicion, he was declared dead on April 21. On Monday, Justice Douglas McKeon of State Supreme Court in the Bronx granted Mr. Genis's request for an injunction barring the hospital from taking Teron off his respirator. 
 Both sides say that in the days that followed, Justice McKeon's mediation eased the impasse between the family and the hospital. On Wednesday night, a doctor not connected to the hospital visited Teron, and confirmed the Montefiore diagnosis that he was brain-dead. Then yesterday, Mr. Genis returned to court at the request of the Francis family, and asked Justice McKeon to vacate the injunction, allowing for Teron's removal from the respirator. 
 Questions remained last night over the treatment Teron received at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital. A hospital spokesman, Errol Schneer, said that on April 15 Teron visited the hospital, where he had long been a dental patient, for a dental procedure, but was forced to reschedule because he was not accompanied by an adult. Three days later, he returned with his mother, and they were both admitted with the same symptoms, Mr. Schneer said. He would not describe the symptoms, but Mr. Genis said that Teron was suffering from headaches and a fever and that his mother complained of hypertension. 
 Shortly afterward, Teron fell into a coma and was transferred to Montefiore. Mr. Genis said his family thinks that the hospital's refusal to perform the dental procedure led to his illness. Mr. Schneer said that the hospital had reviewed the case and found no connection between Teron's dental and medical conditions."

 Re ''Pataki and Bloomberg Endorse Changes in Ground Zero Tower'' (front page, May 5): 
 I'm glad that the construction of the Freedom Tower is profoundly delayed. Let's keep ground zero as it is for a while longer. 
 Rudolph W. Giuliani, in his one shining moment as mayor, led us through the tragedy, kept his calm (and ours), and reminded us that we are New Yorkers. 
 Before he left his job, he instructed New York City to build a ''soaring monumental'' memorial in the space of the World Trade Center. He meant a memorial to the innocent victims of the worst attack on the United States since Pearl Harbor. 
 The design for the Freedom Tower, which was quickly shoved down the public's throat, never impressed me as being a ''soaring monumental'' memorial to anything. 
 On the contrary, it looked like many of the recent grotesque glass towers that have sprouted up around Times Square -- only taller. 
 More important, I and a great many other New Yorkers are not in the mood for something really tall in that area -- yet. We have more mourning to do.

 DEAR Diary: 
 After a semester in Italy, my son returned to Manhattan last June for an internship and his senior year at New York University. He rented a studio in the East Village, so I loaded his things in a van and drove up from our home in Raleigh, N.C. 
 Arriving at 5 p.m. on a Friday, I was delighted to find an open space right in front of his building. 
 Sitting on the stoop was a neighbor enjoying tall-boy Budweisers wrapped in paper bags. Two of them. His eyes said they weren't his first two, either. As we unloaded the van, we had to climb over and around him repeatedly. He would stand, but not desert his roost. Although he did not voice his annoyance, his body language said as much each time he staggered to his feet. 
 Before living in the South for 30 years, I might have suggested that he move so we could have easier access. But I didn't. It took an hour to ferry everything into the apartment. 
 Over the weekend, rather than surrender the parking space, we walked to the Astor Place Kmart several times, bringing back a microwave, a bookshelf and other items. Each return found the neighbor on the stoop, enjoying his favorite beverage. Each trip inside required us to climb over and around him. 
 On Sunday, with all necessary items unpacked, we took the empty boxes to the trash bins. In the hallway stood our friend, now somewhat sober. Spotting us, he asked, ''Youse movin' in?''

 ''Excuse me,'' I said to the woman at the counter. ''Do you have today's New York Times?'' 
 ''I'm not sure,'' she responded. ''Hey,'' she barked at her colleague at the photo lab. ''Do we have The New York Times?'' 
 Her co-worker looked at her somewhat quizzically, and said, ''Uh, I think it's three hours ahead.''

 Amazed, I asked his teacher, ''Are you teaching odd and even numbers?'' Steven, my first grader, was just learning to identify them.

"451","Many Republicans Are Already Eager To Challenge Agreement on Filibusters",1675200,"|u.s.",25,5,2005,"20050525T000000",NA," 
 Angered by a bipartisan deal on judicial nominees, many Senate Republicans warned on Tuesday that they were already eager to challenge the agreement by pushing forward contested candidates, as the Senate cleared the way for the confirmation of the first Bush choice to benefit from the deal. 
 ''This deal is really no deal until it plays out at length,'' said Senator Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho, who said he wanted a vote soon after Memorial Day on the nomination of William G. Myers III, a candidate whose fate was left uncertain in the deal. 
 Just a day after the agreement broke an impasse that had vexed the Senate and the Bush administration for years, senators on both sides of the aisle portrayed the new framework as fragile. Republicans in particular said the bipartisan deal, brokered by seven Democrats and seven Republicans on the eve of a showdown that could have crippled the Senate, would survive only if Democrats refrained from filibustering other emerging nominees, including some who were not guaranteed a vote in the last-minute agreement. 
 Other Republicans threatened to immediately invoke what some have called the nuclear option -- doing away with the filibuster against judicial candidates -- if Democrats tried to block any nominee except in the most extreme cases. 
 ''This is merely a truce; it's not a treaty yet,'' said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and a senior member of the Judiciary Committee. 
 Some leading Republicans also expressed concern about an understanding among the majority of Democrats who signed the agreement that they would agree to block two other nominees backed by Mr. Bush: Brett M. Kavanaugh and William J. Haynes. 
 Mr. Kavanaugh is staff secretary to Mr. Bush, and the White House was alarmed that his confirmation prospects were not enhanced by the agreement. 
 ''We will continue to press for fair up-or-down votes for all nominees,'' said Bob Stevenson, a spokesman for Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader. 
 Democratic lawmakers and senior aides said they had assurances from six of the seven Democrats who participated in reaching the agreement that Mr. Haynes and Mr. Kavanaugh -- who at one point had been named specifically in the agreement but were dropped in later drafts -- would be opposed. 
 ''We feel we have a strong commitment from our colleagues that Kavanaugh and Haynes will not go forward,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No.2 Democrat. 
 The compromise did lead on Wednesday to an 81-to-18 vote to cut off debate on the nomination of Justice Priscilla R. Owen, a Texas Supreme Court member whose nomination has been blocked for four years. 
 ''I appreciate the fact that I'm finally going to get a vote, thanks to your votes,'' Justice Owen said at the White House, where she joined President Bush, Dr. Frist and both Texas senators, who have called for the Senate to act on the nomination. 
 She is expected to be confirmed at noon Wednesday, allowing the Senate to turn to another contentious nomination, that of John R. Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations. 
 Republicans were not alone in their discontent with the new deal. The Congressional Black Caucus, which had joined Senate Democrats in the effort to retain the filibuster, criticized Senate Democrats for agreeing to allow votes on two other nominees -- Justice Janice Rogers Brown, who is black, and William Pryor -- who had records that caucus members considered hostile to civil rights laws. 
 ''This deal is more of a capitulation than a compromise,'' said Representative Melvin Watt, Democrat of North Carolina and the caucus chairman. 
 Architects of the deal in both parties acknowledged it was not perfect, but they said it provided an avenue for the Senate to get beyond the judicial fighting that has taken over the agenda. 
 ''We've all suffered in the eyes of the public,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a signatory to the pact. ''So it's a chance to start over.'' 
 Under the pact ironed out in weeks of negotiations between a shifting cast of Senate characters, seven Democrats agreed to filibuster judicial nominees only in ''extraordinary'' circumstances. In exchange, seven Republicans said they would not support any change in Senate rules to bar filibusters against judicial nominees unless Democrats reneged. 
 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said he viewed the agreement as ending the threat by Dr. Frist to prohibit filibusters. 
 ''It took the nuclear option off the table,'' Mr. Reid said. ''The nuclear option is gone for our lifetime.'' 
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said that he shared Mr. Reid's view and that the Senate had narrowly averted a crisis. 
 ''It does seem to me that the American people want us to get on with the people's business,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''This has been an enormous distraction.'' 
 At the White House, President Bush credited Dr. Frist with forcing the issue in a way that led to a vote for Justice Owen. ''She is my friend, and more importantly, she's a great judge,'' Mr. Bush said. 
 While Republicans said they did not view the compromise as barring a future vote on rules changes, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said it should allow Republicans to speed about a half-dozen stalled nominees to the federal bench, with new nominations expected soon from the White House. 
 Senate leaders took steps Tuesday night to allow votes on three less contentious judicial candidates after the coming holiday break: David W. McKeague, Richard A. Griffin and Thomas B. Griffith. Mr. Reid said he believed Democrats would also agree to a vote on Susan Bieke Neilson. 
 It was uncertain when the Senate might take up the nominations of Justice Brown and Mr. Pryor, who along with Justice Owen were cleared in the compromise. The agreement specifically made no commitment for lawmakers to agree to limit debate on Mr. Myers or Henry Saad, another appeals court nominee. 
 Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, a Democratic leader of the negotiations, said he personally did not intend to support a filibuster of Mr. Myers, saying the outcome of such a vote would be in the hands of the individual lawmakers who agreed to the compromise. 
 That uncertainty surrounding the Myers nomination and a handful of others had some lawmakers viewing the compromise as simply a stopgap, particularly if a Supreme Court vacancy occurs. 
 ''I think it leaves the door wide open for a major blowup down the road,'' said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota.

 After years of wearing the word ''dysfunctional'' like a hair shirt, the New York State Legislature proved that it is actually capable of working. As this year's session ends, legislators and Gov. George Pataki can finally boast that for the first time in years, they operated in a more open way to produce a far better product. 
 Legislators changed some of their worst rules, starting with the most basic -- they ended the embarrassing policy of allowing members to have their vote recorded as ''yes'' on every bill while they were out of the chamber or even out of the city. They also passed the first on-time budget in 21 years -- with far more openness than usual. And, in the last few days, they have agreed to some of the most important reforms in decades: 
 A law to require lobbyists to report any effort to influence state contracts. These contracts are worth billions of dollars a year, but reform-minded legislators and activists have despaired at getting them covered by the basic state lobbying rules. The lobbyists involved, who included friends and relatives of Albany's top politicians, were simply deemed too powerful. Perhaps the difference this year was the publicity over some particularly unsavory transactions -- like the whopping $500,000 fee paid to former Senator Alfonse D'Amato for one phone call to lobby the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
 Closing an outrageous loophole in the ethics law so that state employees can no longer escape ethics charges by simply resigning from their jobs. 
 An agreement -- at last -- to have legislative sessions broadcast statewide, the way Congress is on C-Span. Although there is reasonable worry about the effect television lights will have on attention-starved lawmakers, the public deserves a chance to see their representatives in action, whatever the highs and lows. 
 A long-awaited law requiring computerization of election records around the state, a measure that Common Cause and New York Public Interest Research Group had been pushing intently since they sent researchers around the state and found illegible records and irascible clerks guarding them from the public eye. 
 Expansion of the Freedom of Information Law, which allows public access to state documents. 
 A long-overdue move to make the secretive world of public-private authorities more transparent. 
 Another achievement brought back reminders that there was a time when New York's Legislature was actually regarded as a model for other states, and not a terrible example of what not to do. Legislators set an example for the federal government by voting to make emergency contraception available without a prescription. 
 Why so much energy, so much substance? For one, Albany got a lot of bad press. Even more, several incumbents were defeated or almost defeated, sending a new chill through the Capitol. 
 The bottom line is that a Legislature that seemed almost irredeemable has started to redeem itself. Sure, there are some things we would prefer not to see, a few inside deals that slipped through the night. There are also some big reforms -- of the campaign financing system, for example -- that are still needed. But now we know that New York's legislators can actually deliver if they try hard enough.

"453","Free Speech and Hate Speech: French Ruling Roils the Waters",1683395,"|world",27,6,2005,"20050627T000000","|Europe|France"," 
 According to William Goldnadel, the 4 euros he won in a recent court case here is a windfall for Jews in France. Others only see it adding to a deficit of free speech in Europe. 
 Three French intellectuals and the publisher of the nation's premier newspaper, LeMonde, were ordered by a French court in May to pay 1 euro each to Attorneys Without Borders, which Mr. Goldnadel leads, for defaming Jews in an op-ed article three years ago. The article, the court found, equated Jews with the state of Israel, whose policies the authors sharply criticized. 
 The four men were also told to pay one euro each to an Israeli-French association, and LeMonde was ordered to publish a notice of the court's decision in its pages in the coming months. 
 The case is one of many such complaints to land in European courts in recent years as a surge of emotional discourse -- regarding Muslims after the Sept. 11 attacks and Israel after the second Palestinian intifada -- bumps against post-Nazi laws intended to guard against the fascist hate-mongering of the 1930's. 
 The far-right French politician Jean-Marie Le Pen has been taken to court on several occasions, accused of disparaging Muslims and discounting the Nazis' wartime atrocities. In 2002, the French author Michel Houellebecq was acquitted of inciting racial hatred in a 2001 novel that called Islam ''the stupidest religion.'' 
 Most recently, an Italian judge ordered the journalist Oriana Fallaci to stand trial on charges that she defamed Islam in her 2004 book, ''The Force of Reason.'' She wrote in the book that Islam ''sows hatred in the place of love and slavery in the place of freedom.'' 
 Some here say that Europe is struggling to adjust the boundaries of reasonable debate at the worst possible time. 
 ''The more insecure Europe is about its identity, the more dangerous it is to cross those boundaries,'' said Dominique Moïsi, an international relations specialist. ''Especially now, those boundaries are even more delicate because there is a danger of Europe falling prey to nationalistic and jingoistic reactions.'' 
 Most European countries have laws restricting hate speech that, even if they predate the mid-20th century rise of Nazism, have been reinforced by the shared history of the Holocaust. Even Britain, which protects freedom of speech in a spirit closer to that of the United States, is considering a law against ''incitement of religious hatred'' to go with a law against incitement of racial hatred. 
 Many free-speech cases have been set off since Sept. 11 by criticism of Islam amid concerns about Europe's growing conservative Muslim population. That does not mean that such laws curb speech uniformly across Europe. Enforcement varies according to the national mood, and penalties for infractions are usually low, leaving the field open to anyone willing to face the resulting opprobrium. 
 Theo van Gogh, for example, the Dutch filmmaker murdered in Amsterdam last Nov. 2 by an Islamist activist, was well known for his outrageous public comments about Muslims and Jews. One of his favorite epithets for conservative Muslims evoked bestiality with a goat, while in 1991 he wrote that ''it smells like caramel today, they must be burning the diabetic Jews.'' He was fined the equivalent of a few hundred dollars for that. 
 The case of the article published in LeMonde arose amid a wave of scorn for Israeli policies that swept Europe after the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada in September 2000. The mood soon fueled a surge in anti-Semitism in France, which has the largest Muslim population in Europe. ''Death to Jews!'' was shouted in Paris streets. Jewish children were attacked at schools; synagogues were burned. Emotions peaked during the Israeli Defense Force's reoccupation of Palestinian areas from March to May 2002. Political cartoons across Europe equated Prime Minister Ariel Sharon with Hitler. 
 The article, published in June 2002, was nothing remarkable to American readers accustomed to raucous, sometimes racist public debate. But public criticism of racial or religious groups is forbidden in France, which is vigilant in policing public speech in pursuit of its vision of a homogenous, secular nation free of sectarian divisions. 
 The authors -- one of whom is Jewish -- condemned Mr. Sharon, accusing him of ''oppressing and asphyxiating the Palestinian population.'' 
 One of the passages cited by the court read, ''One finds it hard to imagine that a nation of fugitives descended from the people which has been persecuted the longest in the history of humanity, having been subjected to the worst humiliations and the deepest contempt, would be capable of transforming itself in two generations into a 'dominating and self-assured people' and, with the exception of an admirable minority, a contemptuous people taking satisfaction in humiliating others.'' 
 The phrase ''dominating and self-assured people'' was taken from a speech by Charles de Gaulle, who used it to describe Israelis in the aftermath of the 1967 war. 
 Mr. Goldnadel filed a complaint on behalf of his organization and the France-Israel Association, charging the authors with racial defamation. 
 At the subsequent trial, the judge found that any reasonable reader would understand the attack to be against the Sharon government and its supporters, rather than against all Jews. An appeals court, however, decided that three sentences in the 2,665-word article constituted racial defamation under a 1990 antiracism law. 
 Catherine Cohen, the lawyer for LeMonde, said the defendants had applied for the case to be heard by France's highest court of appeals, the Court of Cassation, which could uphold the verdict or annul it. Either way, the defendants must pay their token fines and LeMonde must publish the verdict in its pages. 
 An open letter in support of the defendants, signed by 100 French intellectuals and published in LeMonde last year, argued that criticizing the Israeli government ''and even the majority of Israelis who support it,'' is far from a condemnation of all Jews. It warned that the case ''shows the serious threat, which often takes the form of intimidation, that is looming over freedom of expression in France.'' 
 But Mr. Goldnadel sees the case as part of a larger shift in what is acceptable in public discourse that began with the start of the second intifada. ''Since the intifada, the media has suddenly discovered freedom of expression,'' he said. ''When speaking of Israel or Zionism they say anything they want to now.'' 
 This is not the first case Mr. Goldnadel has brought against LeMonde: in 1999 he sued the newspaper, accusing it of defaming Serbs by equating them with the policies of Slobodan Milosevic. He lost at trial and won on appeal, but lost in the Court of Cassation. 
 In June 2001, Mr. Goldnadel's group brought charges against Daniel Mermet, a journalist at Radio France, for broadcasting comments from listeners who blamed Jews in general for Israeli policies, complaining that they had exploited the sympathy won during World War II. Mr. Goldnadel lost in the trial and in the appeal. 
 He said he hoped the appeals court decision in the latest case represented an effort to address the sharp rise in anti-Semitism that the government and judiciary have been accused of ignoring. 
 ''No one denies now that there has been a rise in anti-Semitism tied to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,'' he said."
"454","AUTOS ON MONDAY/Technology; Could Cars That Read Minds Save Drivers From Themselves?",1688276,"|technology|science|automobiles",18,7,2005,"20050718T000000",NA," 
 PILOTS log hours in cockpit simulators before they ever take the controls of an airliner, practicing emergency procedures and learning the layout of a plane's instrument panel. Automakers also rely on simulators, though their intent is to study drivers, not train them. 
 In the controlled laboratory setting of a driving simulator, researchers have discovered many things about drivers, including their reluctance to use all of a car's available braking power in a panic stop. Such findings have resulted in electronic systems that sense a panic situation -- by noting how sharply the driver first pushes the brake pedal -- and then continue to apply pressure even if the driver backs off. 
 Today's most advanced cars size up a driver's actions in a number of similar ways; onboard computers stand ready to intervene if the driver makes a dangerous blunder like yanking the steering wheel too sharply in an attempt to avoid a collision. 
 Now Renault, the French automaker that also controls Nissan, is pursuing the possibility that future cars could go a step further, analyzing the driver's actions and adapting the car's mechanical systems to the driver's anticipated moves. 
 An aggressive driver would be allowed to follow close behind a car that cuts in front of him or her, but the brakes would be put on alert for immediate application. In the same situation, with a more timid driver, computers would slow the car down but not apply the brakes suddenly in a way that might alarm drivers following behind. 
 ''We know that 70 percent of accidents come from the driver,'' said Pierre Beuzit, vice president for research at Renault. ''He badly identifies the risks or he reacts badly to an event. We want to create a sort of mathematical model of the psychology of drivers, to use directly in our development programs.'' 
 Studies designed to gain a deeper understanding of drivers, necessary to developing this breed of supersmart cars, are being conducted at a new laboratory that is a joint effort of Renault and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, the French national research center. 
 Driving simulators are interior mock-ups (or in some cases, complete cars) placed on hydraulically actuated platforms and surrounded by video screens and speakers. A driver at the wheel feels vibrations, acceleration and deceleration just as if he were driving on the roads projected around him. 
 ''You save 50 percent of your research time,'' said Dr. Beuzit, noting one reason companies build multimillion-dollar simulators. ''It has transformed the automobile industry in the last 20 to 30 years.'' 
 Because the simulator experience is so close to reality, providing the physical sensation of going around a curve or bouncing over a badly paved road, scientists can use it to do fundamental research on how all the senses contribute to what a driver perceives, said Dr. Andras Kemeny, a research director at the technical center. 
 For Renault, he said, ''It is absolutely necessary to understand the driver's strategy in driving, and then design industrial objects according to this knowledge.'' According to Dr. Kemeny, it would take a decade to complete the loop of bringing fundamental research results to showrooms. 
 Simpler forms of computer simulation technology have been helping automakers speed up the development of new models for decades. By running crash tests with digital models early in the process, they save millions of dollars that would go to building prototypes. Digital simulations of engine cooling systems have reduced the need for summer test drives in Death Valley; evaluating various designs for a heater no longer requires spending a winter in Sweden. 
 Driving simulators at the automakers' research centers are also used to verify that newly developed features work as intended. For instance, the 2007 Mercedes-Benz S-Class, which goes on sale in the United States early next year, will offer an enhanced braking system, called Brake Assist Plus, that uses radar to measure the distance to a car ahead. In a panic stop, it calculates the braking force needed to prevent a collision and applies just the right amount. 
 When 100 drivers tested the system at DaimlerChrysler's driving simulator in Berlin, only 11 percent ''crashed'' into a virtual car that stopped suddenly in front of them. Without it, 44 percent of the drivers ran into the car ahead. 
 Perhaps the most sophisticated facility in the world, the National Advanced Driving Simulator at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, belongs to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. One recent experiment there tested portable telephones controlled by voice commands, and another is studying teenage drivers to learn why they have so many accidents. 
 Renault's research center also has provisions for developing the physical details of production vehicles. Lighting systems can be evaluated in one lab, while a virtual reality test facility allows researchers to test many possibilities for the location of controls, switches and even structural elements like windshield pillars, all by simply altering the view inside special viewing goggles. 
 ''We are using more and more artificial windows on the world,'' said Dr. Kemeny, referring to the computers, televisions and monitors of modern life. ''Portable telephones will soon offer G.P.S. navigation on their small screens. It's a bad idea, but you will use it. Our research will help determine how efficiently you use these tools.''

"455","GAME THEORY: POKER",1694358,"|sports",13,8,2005,"20050813T000000",NA," 
 Despite the fact that bluffing is very much like lying, there is a natural honesty to poker -- something along the lines of honor among thieves -- as well as a democratic fairness. All players remaining in the hand make equal contributions to the pot. Each betting decision is made freely and openly, and in turn. Except for their hole cards, all players have the same information. Noble birth, Ivy League education or a 6-foot-10-inch athlete's body confers no advantage. Misrepresenting the strength of your hand with a bluff is well within the letter and spirit of poker law. 
 In her 2003 memoir, ''Poker Face,'' the poet Katy Lederer compares the ruthlessly analytical minds of her famous poker-playing siblings, Howard Lederer and Annie Duke, to her own way of thinking. ''I was able to 'read' people, but it proved problematic,'' she writes. ''I would sit at my table, look around at my opponents, and try my best to assess them by their postures and expressions, but it would be strangely painful. Or, not painful. It would make me feel dirty. We would sit there, growing filthy together, handling our cards and the dirty plastic chips, trying not to bite our nails for fear of what had lodged itself beneath them.'' 
 Poker's ''dirty'' intimacy and fiduciary hazards aren't for everyone, certainly. Yet its grittiness and peril might help to explain why its outlaw cachet continues to linger, even when today's game is played mostly in state-sanctioned card rooms by well-scrubbed folks sipping mineral water. Crooked Nose McCall gunning down Wild Bill Hickok from behind? An ornery Marlboro Man raising you the ranch from behind mirrored shades? Mirrored shades maybe, but smoking is banned these days in virtually every card room and all major tournaments. So is loutish behavior. 
 The game's image has also improved because of players like Barry Greenstein, who with good reason is called the Robin Hood of Poker: he donates millions of dollars in tournament prize money to children's charities. He has also just published ''Ace on the River: An Advanced Poker Guide.'' 
 In the chapter called ''How to Behave in the Poker Society,'' he wonders to what extent character is exposed at the table. ''Many players who act appropriately in most social situations behave badly when they are losing,'' he writes. ''Maybe we don't see a person's true character at the poker table, but rather, we see him at his worst.'' Other people would argue that it's when the chips are down that character is most clearly revealed. 
 Greenstein admits that at least one ulterior motive for decent behavior is to keep the game ''good'' -- that is, profitable. ''A player who wins the pot should let his opponent win the argument,'' he suggests. ''It is bad business to destroy people,'' this even though ''crybabies deserve something to cry about.'' He goes on to annotate 25 traits of successful players, including being insensitive, manipulative and greedy. Yet it is much more important, in Greenstein's opinion, to be trustworthy, intelligent, honest (with yourself) and psychologically tough. His oversize paperback has hundreds of color photographs of card rooms, casinos and high-stakes players in action, all printed on expensive glossy paper, which gives it the look and feel of an art book -- one that happens to dispense wisdom that could help you win large sums of money. Few people have had more success playing poker in the last 35 years, and Greenstein is known for the precision of his ideas on poker and other subjects, so it's not surprising that his book is tactically instructive. 
 More surprising, perhaps, are the illuminating chapters on brain chemistry, chaos theory, integrity, the hazards of sports betting and how playing poker affects your family and sexuality, and vice versa. ''Casinos hire good-looking employees to attract and distract customers,'' he writes, tongue apparently not in cheek. ''If you are sexually frustrated, you may have trouble concentrating on poker.'' Even winning can lead to problems, because ''chips of large denomination can have an aphrodisiac effect.'' In what sense is this not a good thing? ''Becoming a sugar daddy can have a devastating effect on one's gambling bankroll.'' Better to contribute some of your profits to charity. 
 The most enlightening passage for a non-sugar daddy like me comes right up front in the dedication, which goes to ''the children of gamblers'': ''They were told everything was done so they could have toys and clothes and a nice place to live, but all they wanted was a little more of their parent's time. I apologize to my children,'' Greenstein writes before listing their names, ''for when I have failed as a parent.''

"456","Toyota Hopes to Push Its Hybrids Beyond the Niche",1700116,"|business",7,9,2005,"20050907T000000","|Japan"," 
 With Hurricane Katrina pushing American gas prices above $3 a gallon at the pump, Toyota Motor may find itself in the right place at the right time, with a new, half-mile assembly line capable of producing gasoline-electric hybrid Prius cars at the rate of one a minute. 
 The line, in a factory in Toyota City, is part of a strategy by Japan's largest company to expand hybrids from a niche in the marketplace (just 5 percent of its American sales now) to mainstream (25 percent of its sales by 2010). 
 With oil prices in the range of $70 a barrel, Toyota's investment in energy-saving technology may seem an easy bet. But the gamble by Toyota, the pioneer in producing hybrids, still faces a variety of major challenges, among them increased competition, new tax rules that favor its American competitors and a spreading realization among car buyers that not all hybrids offer big savings on gas. 
 The increasingly competitive marketplace for hybrids may prove to be the biggest challenge for Toyota, whose goal for early in the next decade is to sell a million hybrids worldwide, including 600,000 to Americans. 
 By 2008, Americans can expect to see 10 hybrid models from Toyota, but also a dozen from such brands as Mercury, Dodge, Chevrolet, Nissan and Porsche, as those automakers realize that fuel efficiency may become an important marketing tool. 
 ''I would like to get more hybrids out of our system because I do think it's something that is here to stay,'' William Clay Ford Jr., chairman and chief executive of Ford Motor, told reporters in Detroit on Aug. 23. Last fall, Ford introduced a hybrid version of its Escape sport utility vehicle, the first of several hybrids planned. 
 At the same time, the energy bill signed by President Bush on Aug. 8 effectively gave a break to American manufacturers by extending what could be a tax credit of as much as $3,400 per car to purchasers of the first 60,000 hybrids sold by a company. The credit phases out after that. Toyota sold more than 60,000 hybrids in the first six months of this year, so the tax law seems intended to help General Motors and Ford. 
 Last year, Ford, the only American carmaker currently offering a hybrid comparable to a Prius, sold 2,566, for a 3 percent share of the United States hybrid market. Toyota's hybrid sales, consisting almost exclusively of the Prius, accounted for 64 percent of the 83,153 new hybrids registered in the United States, according to R.L. Polk & Company, a market research firm. Honda was second, with sales of its Civic taking 31 percent of the market. 
 The new tax law ''seems to benefit those who haven't done anything in the area of hybrids until now,'' Christopher Richter, a CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets auto analyst, said in Tokyo. ''And it seems to penalize those who have been pioneers.'' 
 Although hybrids are to be a pillar of Toyota's strategy, Paul Nolasco, a Toyota spokesman, said the company had ''so far been fortunate not to have to depend on government subsidies or tax breaks to encourage sales.'' 
 At the same time, some American drivers are wary of paying as much as $5,000 more for a hybrid that may not be a great fuel saver. 
 As a result, Toyota is fine-tuning its use of the word hybrid. 
 ''We are not marketing them only as highly fuel-efficient vehicles; that is a natural association people have with the word hybrid,'' Mr. Nolasco said, referring largely to the Highlander and the Lexus. ''We are marketing hybrid synergy drive -- great environmental performance and, at the same time, great driving performance.'' 
 In early August, California regulators started to distinguish between fuel-efficient hybrids and ''muscle'' hybrids, the high-powered versions that save little gasoline. Of the seven hybrid models now on sale in the United States, owners of the Honda Civic, Honda Insight and Toyota Prius can qualify for decals allowing them to drive alone, rather than with two or more passengers, in highway commuter lanes. That reward is not extended to four hybrids not rated as exceptional energy savers: Honda Accord, Ford Escape, Toyota Highlander and Lexus RX 400h. 
 But with Americans paying $40 or more for a tank of gasoline, hybrid is a label that carmakers believe will draw buyers into their showrooms. Earlier this year, American demand was so strong that a used 2004 Prius sometimes sold for as much as the window sticker price on a new one. 
 In July and August, in fact, the Prius was the model with the biggest jump -- 68 percent -- in Internet information searches on Cars.com, according to the Web site's Consumer Search Index, released last week. 
 ''The challenge is how to expand hybrid technology to more models and more lines,'' Masatami Takimoto, Toyota's executive vice president in charge of advanced power train and engine technology, said at the company's new steel and glass global headquarters. ''My personal desire is to put the hybrid to all the models. But it cannot be done overnight, only step by step.'' 
 Some drivers have said that the actual mileage of the Prius, Toyota's third-most -popular car in the United States after the Camry and Corolla, often falls short of its federal economy rating. But Mr. Takimoto, responding to that criticism, said, ''The majority of customers say that their second-generation Prius gets much better mileage than their old car.'' 
 He said Toyota was meeting with officials at the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States to review their gas mileage measurement system. Hybrids get their best mileage in the stop-and-go traffic of cities and suburbs, when they largely run on their electric motors. 
 ''A lot depends on how you drive them,'' Kurt Sanger, Japan automotive analyst for Macquarie Securities, said in Tokyo. ''If you gun them at every red light, you are not going to get 44 miles to the gallon.'' He said Toyota needed to ''redouble its educational effort in that regard.'' 
 With Toyota determined to sell a million hybrid vehicles worldwide, or about 10 percent of its forecast sales for 2010, it is clear that the company is methodically making hybrid vehicles a core of its plans for growth. 
 In late June, Katsuaki Watanabe, the president of Toyota, expanded his team of executive vice presidents in charge of high technology to three, from one. Mr. Takimoto, a veteran of 35 years of hybrid research at Toyota, will oversee the hybrid program. 
 Flush with $10.5 billion in profits from last year, a record, Toyota is expanding its research and development budget this year by 10 percent, to $6.9 billion, although it would not disclose how much of that was for hybrids. Nor would Japan's second- and third-largest car companies, Nissan Motor and Honda Motor, which are also increasing their research budgets by similar percentages. Honda's will go to $4.65 billion and Nissan's to $4.1 billion. 
 Toyota has about 650 patents on its hybrid technology, the fruits of $800 million reportedly spent to develop the Prius. Toyota licenses its hybrid technology to Nissan and Ford. 
 The company says it has reached the break-even point on its hybrid technology, but Kunihiko Shiohara, chief automotive analyst for Goldman Sachs Japan, said it was impossible to confirm that assertion without knowing how much was spent on research and development. 
 Mr. Sanger, of Macquarie Securities, said, ''The benefit of being Toyota is that you are making so much money in so many areas you can take a long-term strategy.'' He added that Toyota could afford to lose money with hybrids while gaining market share and consumer acceptance. 
 Nissan is expected to produce a hybrid version of its Altima in 2006. General Motors, the largest carmaker inthe world, and DaimlerChrysler, the fifth-largest carmaker, have signed a deal to develop hybrid vehicle technology jointly. 
 Honda, too, is trying to increase sales of its hybrids, although it is not staking out lofty goals for expansion. Sales figures indicate that Honda, the second-biggest Japanese carmaker in the American market, will sell about 42,000 hybrids in the United States this year, largely Civics. Although this will be a 55 percent jump over last year, the total will be small compared with Toyota's forecast hybrid sales in the United States of 140,000. Hybrids account for about 3 percent of Honda's sales in the United States. 
 ''We believe the market for hybrid cars will expand in North America,'' Kenzo Suzuki, the executive chief engineer of Honda. ''We want to be ready to expand. Our thinking is the gasoline price will continue to go up. With that in mind, we have to develop hybrid cars.'' 
 Japan's three leading car companies see hybrid cars as a halfway step toward an ultimate goal of selling gasoline-free hydrogen-cell cars. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Japan predicts that 50,000 hydrogen-powered vehicles will be on Japan's roads in 2010, and as many as 5 million by 2020. 
 Initially, all of Toyota's hybrids were made in Japan. But this fall, Prius production is to start in China, marking the first overseas production of the hybrid. Those cars are for the Chinese market. 
 Next year, Toyota is to start making a hybrid Camry at the company's Kentucky plant. And a Toyota pickup truck plant is to open next year in San Antonio, with some of the trucks produced there expected to be hybrids. 
 ''To us, it's not a passing phase but a vital technology for the 21st century,'' Jim Press, president and chief operating officer of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., told a recent auto industry conference in Michigan.

"458","Monitors Find Significant Fraud in Afghan Elections",1706924,"|world",3,10,2005,"20051003T000000","|Afghanistan"," 
 Election officials and observers said Sunday that with 80 percent of the ballots counted in Afghanistan's national and provincial elections, they had found significant incidents of fraud. 
 Whole districts have come under suspicion for ballot box stuffing and proxy voting, said Peter Erben, the chief of the United Nations-assisted Joint Election Management Board. He said ballot boxes from 4 percent of the 26,000 polling places -- about 1,000 stations -- had been set aside for investigation on suspicion of fraud and other irregularities. 
 The European Union observer mission said the reports of fraud and possible voter intimidation in places were ''worrying.'' In a statement, the mission said, ''While these phenomena do not appear to be nationwide, they are a cause for concern.'' 
 Mr. Erben promised strong action and said that if there was a clear indication of fraud, the votes in question would be excluded from the general count. The Election Complaints Commission could also warn, fine and disqualify candidates if there was evidence of tampering, he said. 
 ''We are taking irregularities very seriously,'' he said. 
 One of the worst cases has been in Paghman, a district west of Kabul, which is the stronghold of Abdul Rab Rassoul Sayyaf, a wartime faction leader and ally of President Hamid Karzai. Ballot boxes from 95 polling stations in Paghman have been set aside for further inspection and 30 to 40 of those had been cleared for counting by Sunday, officials said. 
 The rest would be excluded from the count because of clear evidence of fraud, said a foreign observer who lacked permission to speak to reporters and asked not be identified. 
 Mr. Sayyaf is running for a seat in the Wolesi Jirga, or the lower house of Parliament, and is in fourth place with 2,105 votes. Only 20 percent of the results for Kabul have been tabulated so far, but he is nevertheless well placed to win one of the 33 seats in the province. 
 Mr. Erben said that there were no signs of countrywide efforts to defraud the Afghan people but that there had been local efforts. ''I do not believe these irregularities in any way have affected the overall elections, but some of them have surely affected them locally,'' he said. Voters went to the polls Sept. 18 to choose representatives for Parliament from each province, and for members of provincial councils. 
 ''If compared with other, similar, postconflict elections, I think that the level of irregularities that we are currently reviewing is extremely reasonable,'' Mr. Erben said at a news conference. 
 A ''very high number'' of polling stations in Paktika, a southeastern province that includes the tribal areas on the border with Pakistan, were also under review because of accusations of proxy voting, Mr. Erben said. Ballot boxes from 271 stations were quarantined in Paktika pending investigation, he said. 
 Another 300 boxes were quarantined in Herat, a western province, Tolo TV reported, quoting the local election supervisor. 
 The American military said Saturday that an American soldier and an Afghan soldier were killed Friday in a clash with insurgents in Kandahar, and an American soldier and two Afghans were wounded. Violence in Afghanistan has increased in recent months as Taliban insurgents have stepped up efforts to drive out the Afghan government and foreign troops."

 About a year ago, a girl was born in this working-class town and was promptly flung out of a third-floor window. She tumbled down a thin air shaft, naked, her umbilical cord still attached. Her head smashed into the concrete 31 feet below. She died instantly. And there she lay, unnamed, buried in a grave of garbage and cigarette packs. 
 The story gets worse. 
 On the morning of Sept. 13, another baby was born and he, too, was shoved through the same window, splattering blood through neighbors' window panes as he fell, landing with a thud near the decaying body of his sister. His screams cut through the walls, and neighbors called the police. His skull cracked, and his eye was blackened, but he lived. 
 The story gets worse. 
 The authorities soon learned that the mother of the two children was Lucila Ventura, an 18-year-old immigrant from El Salvador. Their father was a 44-year-old named Jose Julio Ventura. But he is not just the father of Lucila's children, the police say. He is also their grandfather. 
 This tale of incest, abuse and murder has shaken nearly everyone involved here. Edward J. De Fazio, the Hudson County prosecutor, has called the case a ''vivid explosion of family dysfunction.'' 
 ''I've never seen anything quite like this,'' Mr. De Fazio said in an interview. ''And I've been involved in this kind of work for some time.'' 
 As many try to make sense of the horrific events here, so much remains a mystery. And like all mysteries, there are questions and bewilderment. 
 ''Everyone was saying, 'How could the mother not know what was going on?''' said Maria Ortiz, 40, who lived above the family and yet knew next to nothing about them. ''It's sad, very sad.'' She paused. ''And disgusting.'' 
 Ms. Ventura has been charged with murder, attempted murder, endangering the welfare of a child and child abuse. If convicted, she could be sentenced to up to 40 years in prison. The authorities say she threw both of her babies out the window shortly after giving birth to them in the tiny apartment she shared with her mother, father, four brothers and uncle. Prosecutors have not decided whether to try her as an adult in the death of her first child. Her lawyer says that her father had possibly been abusing her for several years. 
 Mr. De Fazio suggested in an interview that he was trying to pry information from Ms. Ventura so that he could charge the father with a more serious offense. ''In order to pursue the case against the father, Lucila would need to be a state's witness,'' Mr. De Fazio said. 
 She is undergoing a psychiatric evaluation, according to the authorities. Mr. Ventura is charged with aggravated sexual assault, endangering the welfare of a child and child abuse, though the results of a paternity test for the babies are not back. He has not been implicated in the killings. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment, with bail set at $500,000. If convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison. 
 Mr. Ventura's public defender, E. Carl Broege, said his client is far from the ''beast'' portrayed in media accounts. Instead, he said, his client was a ''pathetic little man'' who seemed ''scared and subdued, and he seemed not to comprehend what was happening.'' 
 Both father and daughter are now being held at the Hudson County Correction Center in Kearny. 
 The young life of Lucila Ventura is one that has been lived out of sight, behind closed doors, away from others. Though her family has lived in New Jersey for some time, she joined them about six years ago, after living with a grandmother in El Salvador, according to a person involved in the investigation. 
 For at least six years, she has lived in a two-bedroom apartment on 64th Street with her family, relatives and neighbors said. But she was never seen outside hanging on the stoop, like other teenagers in her neighborhood, many say. She slept in a room with her parents and a younger brother, according to relatives. Her parents said little more than ''hello'' to neighbors in the building. Even cousins of Ms. Ventura's who live in the same building say they had no idea that she had ever been pregnant, or that her father had been abusing her. 
 ''I couldn't believe it,'' said Aleyda Romero, 15, a cousin of Ms. Ventura's who lived a floor below and saw her two days before the birth in September. 
 She said of her uncle and cousin: ''They got along with each other. We never saw him doing something to her.'' She added: ''We couldn't believe he was the father.'' 
 Ms. Ventura's lawyer, Anthony J. Fusco Jr., said in a news conference last month that the abuse might have lasted for several years. 
 ''We are now learning that this abuse may have started to occur when she was 13 or 14 years old and continued on multiple occasions each week for years,'' he said. Through a secretary, Mr. Fusco declined to comment further. 
 Nearly every weekday, Mr. Ventura, a cook who worked the night shift at a local restaurant, put his daughter in a green minivan and drove her 13 blocks to Memorial High School, according to relatives and classmates. Often, he would pick her up during lunch. And when school was dismissed at 3 p.m., he picked her up again and took her back home. The mother had worked as a laborer in the jewelry business during the day. 
 While she was in school, Lucila never did much to distinguish herself to classmates. 
 ''She would walk down the hall with her head down,'' said one of those classmates, George Triantafyllopoulos, 18, ''like she was invisible.'' 
 Even now, a month after the news broke -- during which students at Memorial High School have been lectured about their options for unwanted babies -- many students and teachers responded to the mention of Lucila Ventura's name with a puzzled expression and a one-word question. 
 ''Who?'' 
 Classmates said that Ms. Ventura was an enigma: a loner who was never picked on, a girl who never had a boyfriend and who never seemed able to connect with other students. When he was a freshman, Mr. Triantafyllopoulos said that he and another friend approached Ms. Ventura in gym class. ''Me and a girl would try to talk to her and she would just walk away,'' he said. 
 She had been a student in the English as a Second Language program since starting high school four years ago, said the principal, Matthew Sinisi. 
 Another classmate, Kayla Rivas, 16, said that while Ms. Ventura ''was always a quiet person, shy,'' they would sometimes talk about ''girl stuff'' in gym. She did not mention any problems with her father, Kayla said. When asked what, exactly, they would talk about, Kayla shrugged and said, ''You know, girl stuff.'' 
 In this tightly packed, 1.3-square mile working class city of immigrants from Cuba, Mexico, Colombia and Ecuador, children play on the sidewalk and the streets teem on a weekday afternoon. Its luxury high-rise apartments face Midtown Manhattan. 
 West New York also suffers with a poverty rate of 19 percent. Students say that the high school has grappled in the past with MS-13, the Central American gang. Some students said teenage pregnancy is not considered unusual. 
 Amid this, Lucila Ventura had seemed like a ''good girl,'' according to Ms. Ortiz. No one -- teachers, neighbors, even relatives -- seemed to notice that she had twice been pregnant. She was heavyset, Ms. Ortiz said, and no one noticed a protruding belly. 
 According to a person familiar with the situation, Lucila Ventura might be mentally ''limited'' in some way. The source did not want to be named for fear of compromising the investigation. Prosecutors are awaiting an assessment of her mental condition. Ms. Ventura's lawyer, Mr. Fusco, has said in newspaper interviews that his client might have been insane when she threw the babies out the window, a defense that, if successful, could result in her release, supervision or commitment to a psychiatric institution. 
 The cousin, Aleyda Romero, said that she saw Ms. Ventura in the hallway of their building Sept. 11, two days before the birth, and she asked her if she would be in school on Monday, since she had not seen her on Friday. ''And she said, 'Yeah.''' 
 Though she said she did not notice anything unusual, she nonetheless asked Ms. Ventura what was wrong. ''She said she ate something and she felt bad after,'' Aleyda said. 
 She said she did not see her cousin in school on Monday. On Tuesday, the baby was born. 
 After the most recent baby was found, The Jersey Journal interviewed Ms. Ventura's mother, Maria. ''We had no clue she was pregnant. She hid it from us,'' Maria Ventura told The Journal. ''She wore loose, baggy clothes.'' 
 She said she had assumed that her daughter had a stomachache and she made her cinnamon tea before leaving for work on the morning her daughter gave birth. 
 For now, the month-old boy who survived the plunge into the air shaft remains in the care of the state's Division of Youth and Family Services. 
 He has recovered from his fractured skull, and is in a ''special medical placement'' in Hudson County, awaiting a transfer to a foster home. He has been named David, said Andy Williams, a spokesman for the agency. 
 Relatives had expressed interest in caring for the baby, but Mr. Williams and others deemed that scenario ''highly unlikely.'' 
 ''Family members have to be considered,'' he said. ''But our recommendation to the court, based on circumstances in the house, we'd need more clarity before placing the child with someone from that household.'' 
 Initially, as the police responded to reports of a crying infant, they found only David, with no clue to how he got to the bottom of the 3.5-by-5-foot shaft. But as they looked up, they saw blood on the windowsill of the Venturas' bathroom window. Once inside the apartment, the police said, investigators found blood everywhere. 
 A day later, as maintenance workers cleared the garbage that had broken the newborn's fall, they found what they thought was a doll. It turned out to be the mummified remains of his sister. 
 Mr. De Fazio, the prosecutor, said that Ms. Ventura's mental state will play a significant role in the case, but noted: ''It should never lead to these babies being thrown out the window, like they were some piece of garbage.'' 
 He, too, was having a hard time explaining what had happened. ''I don't think you can understand it,'' he said. ''It's complete dysfunction. It's a complete breakdown of the family.''"

 Judging Craters 
 To estimate the surface age of an object in the solar system, astronomers often count craters. Since the frequency of bombardment by asteroids and comets is fairly well known, the number of craters on a moon, say, can be a good indicator of how long the surface has been exposed. It's a little like gauging the age of a horse by seeing how much the teeth are worn down. 
 One problem with the method is that it is not always easy to tell if a crater is a primary one from a direct impact or a secondary one caused by material ejected from a large primary impact. 
 If a lot of craters, particularly smaller ones, are counted as primaries but are in fact secondaries, an age estimate can be inaccurate. 
 A study of the craters on Jupiter's icy moon Europa suggests that secondary craters are more common than previously thought. 
 The analysis, by Edward B. Bierhaus of Lockheed Martin's space exploration systems division and colleagues from the Southwest Research Institute, found that about 95 percent of Europa's small craters (those less than about half a mile across) are secondaries. 
 The researchers measured more than 27,000 craters from images of Europa and used software to study their spatial distribution. 
 Secondary craters tend to be in clusters, but the researchers, who reported their findings in Nature, concluded that even many craters that appear randomly distributed are secondaries. 
 A large primary impact produces many fragments that sail long and far, becoming quite separated spatially. 
 The study suggests that using small craters to estimate surface age is a questionable proposition, on Europa and perhaps elsewhere in the solar system. 
 And because comets are thought to be the main source of impacts on Europa and other jovian moons, the study suggests that there have been relatively few small comets (less than 100 yards in diameter, the kind that would make small craters) passing through the region in recent times. 
 Antifreeze: Fleas Do It 
 To avoid tissue injury or death, creatures that live in extremely cold environments need protection. That means some kind of antifreeze, proteins that prevent freezing of blood or other fluids by suppressing the formation of ice crystals. 
 Antifreeze proteins are most commonly thought of as occurring in fish, particularly saltwater species that can survive in salt water that is colder than 32 degrees Fahrenheit. But other animals and plants have been discovered to have them, too. 
 The latest is the lowly snow flea, a tiny creature that can be found on the surface of snow. 
 Laurie A. Graham and Peter L. Davies of Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, report in Science that the flea (which is not a flea or even an insect, but rather a springtail) has unique antifreeze proteins that do not resemble those found in any other known organism. 
 The proteins contain a lot of the amino acid glycine and were more active than the proteins found in fish, meaning they were able to provide protection at lower temperatures -- more than 10 degrees below the freezing point in tests. 
 The researchers say their finding suggests that freezing protection developed independently among arthropod species. 
 Distinct species may have evolved in a warmer climate, and then when things got colder, each species adapted on its own. 
 Lambchop Genome 
 Think you know a lot about sheep? The Australians have you beaten by a mile. Wool and meat industry groups there have announced the creation of a database containing genetic information about two million of the animals. 
 The goal of Sheep Genetics Australia, as the project is known, is to improve breeding by allowing sheep breeders and producers to compare flocks on a genetic basis. 
 While two million is a lot of animals, it represents only about 2 percent of Australia's sheep population. Still, that's enough for meaningful genetic evaluations to be made. 
 The Bird Next Door 
 Like New Yorkers who head to Florida for the holidays every year, European blackcaps long had a preferred winter destination. The migratory songbirds would leave their breeding territory in central Europe and head southwest for Spain and Portugal. 
 In the last few decades, however, more and more of the birds have flown northwest, to spend winter in the British Isles. The reasons for this split -- and similar changes in migration patterns among other birds -- are little known. 
 A study by Stuart Bearhop of Queen's University Belfast and colleagues sheds some light on the mechanism. At the breeding grounds in Germany and Austria, the researchers report in Science, blackcaps tend to mate with others that have wintered in the same place. This mating pattern has led to the development of the separate migratory population. 
 For the study, Dr. Bearhop said, ''We really needed to be able to identify birds coming from England and those from Spain and Portugal.'' To do so, they took claw clippings from the birds and analyzed them for different isotopes of hydrogen. Different rainfall patterns in the wintering areas produce different ratios of hydrogen isotopes in the water. As the birds drink the water, the ratios are reflected in growing tissues like claws. 
 Dr. Bearhop and his colleagues clipped birds' claws at eight breeding sites. When they studied mating patterns among the identified birds, ''the data strongly suggested that birds are pairing up with birds from the same general area,'' Dr. Bearhop said. They probably do so because birds from Britain arrive at the breeding sites about 10 days before those from Iberia. 
 Birds that migrate to more northern breeding sites were also shown to produce more offspring than those who flew farther south. This might be due to several factors, Dr. Bearhop said. Northerly migrators have a shorter trip, so they can save more energy for reproduction. By arriving earlier, they get the best breeding sites. And Britons tend to make life easy for migrating birds by putting out feeders. 
 Dr. Bearhop said the migratory shift probably started with a few birds that went to Britain, returned, mated and produced more offspring, which in turn went to Britain, and on and on. ''This has very probably been going on for a very long time,'' Dr. Bearhop said. ''Britain has become a very good place for them to overwinter.''

 Mozart's ''Ave Verum Corpus,'' chaste and touching, followed by Arvo Pärt's ''Fratres,'' sparse and ascetic, served as quiet introductions to the Mozart Requiem on Thursday night at Carnegie Hall. The Orchestra of St. Luke's played. Donald Runnicles conducted. The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chamber Chorus sang splendidly. There were also four well-matched vocal soloists. 
 Running the three pieces together -- uninterrupted by applause and separated only by general throat clearing and some reseating of orchestra members -- did reasonably well at sustaining a mood. It also solved the problem of how to present the Requiem on a normal one-and-a-half-to-two-hour concert program otherwise divided by an intermission. 
 Given the quality of the playing and singing, the practical solutions were of minor interest. I was very taken by the Atlanta singers, prepared by Norman Mackenzie, whose members I am sure are amateur or semiprofessional at best. Beautifully trained and absolutely focused, they offered in particular a soprano section singing with a purity unmuddied by vibrato and individual excess. 
 The St. Luke's players played handsomely as a full orchestra and just as well as an all-cello octet in Mr. Pärt's piece. What a pleasure it was, as well, to hear a vocal quartet so mutually aware and free of competitiveness. One sensed the strong, wise hand of Mr. Runnicles. Celena Shafer was the heartfelt soprano and Nathan Berg the elegant and substantial bass-baritone. John Tessier, tenor, and Kristine Jepson, mezzo-soprano, were scarcely less good. 
 The brief, unadorned ''Ave Verum Corpus'' worked its usual magic. ''Fratres'' repeats an expanding and contracting, chantlike theme. The musical term lontano describes its methodology: music beginning at a distance and becoming nearer and stronger. The unfinished Requiem has regularly attracted completers, some presumptuous, and also touch-up artists like Robert Levin, whose edition was used on Thursday. 
 Mr. Levin's work is a little like dealing with old furniture. Discreet repair of damaged detail may enhance quality and value. Refinishing surfaces at the expense of accumulated patina, on the other hand, is usually disastrous. As a restorer, Mr. Levin is wise enough to fix little things and leave bigger ones as they are.

 The United States opened a consulate in Juba, the primitive, hardscrabble town that is the capital of Southern Sudan. Robert B. Zoellick, the deputy secretary of state, officiated. The United States helped broker the peace agreement this year that ended a 21-year civil war between the mainly Muslim north and the Christian and animist south. It calls for power sharing, and Mr. Zoellick has been pushing the Sudanese government to implement its terms. Officials said the new consulate was intended to demonstrate that the United States will remain engaged. A senior official said two diplomats had so far applied to be consul general in Juba, where there is no indoor plumbing.

 Francesca Gabbiani, a 40-year-old Los Angeles artist, creates large collages by cutting up colored paper and gluing the pieces together. Collage inspired her architect, Kevin Daly, of Daly, Genik in Santa Monica, Calif., to envision her studio as a series of three silvery corrugated steel boxes. 
 ''I took the boxes apart and put them back together,'' Mr. Daly said, ''making the studio a self-portrait of the artist and her work.'' 
 The boxes break up the work space into two parts: an expansive studio (the biggest box) and an adjacent office (the medium-size one). The third sits on top of the other two and is effectively an innovative skylight that combines high tech materials and hand craftsmanship. Made of polycarbonate panels, the skylight is screened with slats of reclaimed wood, which wash the studio with even, indirect natural light. 
 An outdoor ''painting terrace'' -- used for airbrushing Ms. Gabbiani's pictures -- is a bonus, since the building sits snugly on the hillside behind the 60's ranch house in the Silver Lake neighborhood which she shares with her husband, Ed Ruscha Jr., an artist and a musician, and their toddler son, Milo. 
 Ms. Gabbiani's collages often depict interior scenes that resemble movie backdrops. 
 ''In my old studio, if I made a big piece I could barely see it,'' she said. ''But now I can invite my friends.'' Daly, Genik Architects, (310) 656-3180, www.dalygenik.com.

 WITH the world reeling from disasters, both natural and man-made, a wandering sports columnist is sometimes a few days behind or ahead of tragedy. For all that, there were great events and charismatic athletes -- in addition to memorable datelines for a new set of postcards. 
 PORT ST. LUCIE, FLA., FEB. 17 -- On a coast recently disfigured by hurricanes, spring training begins. Two former rivals, Willie Randolph and Pedro Martínez, are united as the Mets' manager and their ace. Martínez will give Randolph a superlative season, on and off the field. 
 WASHINGTON, MARCH 2 -- Jackie Robinson, the pioneer Brooklyn Dodger, is honored with the Congressional Gold Medal in the Capitol Rotunda as dozens of black lawmakers attend. President Bush and Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate Democratic leader, share a rare moment of bipartisan agreement in praising Robinson. 
 WASHINGTON, MARCH 17 -- Mark McGwire is the most visibly pathetic of five baseball stars testifying before Congress, declining to address his use of a body-building drug. Rafael Palmeiro will be humbled in August, when he is suspended for 10 games after testing positive for steroids. Before the year is out, pressure from Congress will shame the union and the owners into accepting much stricter penalties. 
 BIRMINGHAM, ALA., MARCH 29 -- Roderick Jackson, a teacher and family man, jeopardized his livelihood by taking on the school board for the right of his girls basketball team to have facilities matching the boys'. Today he quietly celebrates a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision that essentially protects whistleblowers. Then he excuses himself to go back to his students. 
 WASHINGTON, APRIL 14 -- After 33 years, baseball returns to D.C. as the relocated Montreal Expos, now the Washington Nationals, defeat Arizona, 5-3. Frank Robinson's team will finish with a respectable 81-81 record and draw 2.7 million fans, eighth best in the National League. 
 BOSTON, APRIL 11 -- Two classes in nearby Acton, Mass., have proposed that the Yankees and the Red Sox shake hands at the home opener, in a gesture of sportsmanship. Although this is not about to happen, most Yankees do sit respectfully in the dugout to observe the Boston sports heroes Johnny Pesky, Bobby Doerr, Dominic DiMaggio, Bill Russell, Bobby Orr, Tedy Bruschi and Richard Seymour take the field as the Red Sox receive their 2004 World Series rings. 
 AUGUSTA, GA., APRIL 18 -- Lance Armstrong, not yet 34, announces he will retire after this summer's Tour de France. Then he leads his Discovery Channel team for a week's romp in the Tour de Georgia. 
 NEW YORK, MAY 25 -- Stunned Italian fans put aside old regional rivalries and root for A.C. Milan at L'Angolo in Greenwich Village. On television from far-off Istanbul, Liverpool ties the score after trailing at halftime, 3-0, then beats Milan on penalty kicks, in one of the greatest reversals in a Champions League final. 
 LONDON, JUNE 29 -- It's not every day that a Yank sports columnist walks up to 10 Downing Street and interviews Tony Blair. Blair will travel to Singapore in a few hours to promote London's candidacy to be the 2012 Olympic host. Paris has the perceived edge, but Blair's competitive streak is matched by that of Sebastian Coe, the track gold medalist and the leader of the London bid group. 
 WIMBLEDON, England, JULY 3 -- A stunned Andy Roddick wins only 12 games from Roger Federer in three sets in the Wimbledon final, and says, ''I want it real bad, but he's beating me.'' A day earlier, Venus Williams outlasted Lindsay Davenport in a tense three-set final. 
 PARIS, JULY 6 -- With a dark cloud dropping sprinkles over City Hall, at 1:49 p.m., Parisians learn the host of the 2012 Summer Games. ''Londres, London,'' says a voice from distant Singapore. The Parisians scuttle away, almost silently. New York's impractical dream of a mixed-use West Side facility has been mercifully rejected. 
 NANCY, FRANCE, JULY 7 -- Driving to catch up with the Tour de France, I hear on French radio descriptions of terrorist bombings in London, where we were taking the Underground and buses a few days earlier. 
 KARLSRUHE, GERMANY, JULY 8  -- ''I'm more afraid than in the past,'' Armstrong admits in a morning cellphone chat. Going for his seventh straight championship, Armstrong says he plans to avoid nasty collisions on this rainy day, knowing his mates will protect him. 
 COURCHEVEL, FRANCE, JULY 12  -- Armstrong regains the lead in the Tour, even though he appears to ease up from the saddle during a close uphill finish in the Alps, allowing a young Spaniard to win the stage. Lance knows what he needs, day by day. 
 ST-LARY-SOULAN, FRANCE, JULY 17 -- Paying homage to a friend, Fabio Casartelli, who died in a crash on this course 10 years earlier, Armstrong maintains his lead. His chief blocker, big George Hincapie, wins his first stage in a tense climb high in the Pyrenees. 
 GAILLAC, FRANCE, JULY 20 -- My wife and I vote this the most perfect evening of the Tour -- dinner with my cousin Jen and her husband, Sam, in La Verrerie, a tiny auberge in the woods, under a full moon, two fish courses, great wine. Circling this beautiful country, we feel privileged to revisit Nancy, Strasbourg, Grenoble, Montpelier, Pau, Toulouse, Lyon. Months later, we will follow the urban unrest in French cities. 
 ST-ÉTIENNE, FRANCE, JULY 23 -- Armstrong wins the time trial to clinch his championship. Tomorrow he will cycle into drizzly Paris to celebrate. But the sport is haunted by suggestions of widespread drug use by some riders. 
 PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y., SEPT. 1 -- Many a sports journalist has spent time in New Orleans, now devastated by Hurricane Katrina. I mourn for the people of that unique city, and rage at the ineptitude of public officials. 
 NEW YORK, SEPT. 10 and 11 -- At Flushing Meadows, two of the most popular and athletic players in the game, Roger Federer and Kim Clijsters, win the United States Open this weekend. The best match? Andre Agassi dispatching the local favorite, James Blake, in a five-set late-night quarterfinal. 
 BOSTON, OCT. 7 -- Last year they were idiots. The year before they were cowboys. This year the Red Sox are history, going down in three straight games in the first round to another ancient franchise, the White Sox. 
 CHICAGO, OCT. 23 -- After yet another umpiring call goes their way, the White Sox take a 2-0 lead in the World Series. ''Maybe it's Shoeless Joe,'' says Brad Ausmus, the astute Houston catcher, perhaps sensing that the White Sox are about to exorcise the gloomy spell dating to Joe Jackson and the scandalous 1919 Black Sox. 
 NEW YORK, NOV. 5 -- After a year's absence because of a labor dispute, hockey is back, with more wide-open play under new rules. 
 NEW YORK, NOV. 16 -- Nine fans jam into a Brooklyn apartment to watch Trinidad and Tobago play Bahrain for the first World Cup berth for one of the teams. Before the game, Paul Caligiuri of the United States, who helped beat T&T 16 years earlier to keep it out of the World Cup, calls my cellphone to wish luck to the fans. Two hours later, the Trinis are happy. 
 SEATTLE, NOV. 27 -- Jay Feely misses three late field goals for the Giants, then has the character to address reporters. The surging Seahawks seem likely to play host to a playoff game or two in January. 
 NEW YORK, NOV. 30 -- Tony Stewart, winner of the Nextel Cup, burns rubber in the canyons of Midtown as Nascar celebrates its new TV contract and its growth around the United States. 
 LEIPZIG, GERMANY, DEC. 9 -- Bach and Mendelssohn once composed in this tiny city in the eastern part of the country. Now FIFA holds its draw for the 2006 World Cup, putting the United States in a rugged group with the Czech Republic, Italy and Ghana. I wonder how many of the 12 host cities I will be able to visit in 2006 -- for epic games, for new postcards. In the meantime, Happy New Year.  Sports of The Times"

 A Brooklyn police officer accidentally shot another officer in the leg yesterday while trying to shoot at a teenager who was pointing a gun at him, the police said. 
 The shooting occurred at 2:15 p.m. on a busy street in Fort Greene after a group of officers, answering a call of shots being fired in the neighborhood, began chasing a teenager who a witness had seen with a gun, the police said. 
 At some point during the chase, the police said, the teenager pulled out a gun in front of the Ingersoll public housing complex on Myrtle Avenue and pointed it at the officers, prompting them to open fire. 
 The police said one of the officers, whose name was not released, fired three shots at the teenager, Clayton Givens, 17, who lives in the housing complex and has a criminal history, including convictions for resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer. 
 Mr. Givens was not hit, but Officer Giancarlo Raspanti, 30, who was responding separately to the call, was grazed in the leg as he was running toward Mr. Givens from the opposite end of the street. 
 Officer Raspanti was taken to New York Methodist Hospital in Park Slope, where he was treated for a flesh wound. Doctors at the hospital said he was not badly hurt but would remain at the hospital overnight for observation. He has been with the department for nine years. 
 Mr. Givens continued running after the shooting but was arrested by other officers 30 yards away in front of a car wash, said Raymond W. Kelly, the police commissioner. Mr. Kelly said the shooting was still under investigation and would be the focus of a customary review by a firearms discharge review committee. Charges were pending last night. 
 He said that the police found a gun on Mr. Givens, and that it was a .38-caliber Smith and Wesson that had been stolen in Prince Georges County, Md., in 2004. 
 Although Mr. Kelly said the police officers acted appropriately by firing at Mr. Givens, several witnesses questioned the Police Department's account, including James Green, 64, who lives in the housing complex and said he saw the shooting unfold. 
 ''I didn't see him turn around at all,'' Mr. Green said. ''He was running too fast to turn around.'' 
 Steven Givens, the teenager's father, said his son was a high school dropout who stayed home and baby-sat for his younger brother and sister and coached basketball each summer. 
 ''I've never never ever seen my kid with a gun,'' he said. ''And if anybody started shooting, I'd run too.'' 
 The police said someone reported hearing six shots fired at 177 Sands Street in Fort Greene about 2 p.m. 
 Fifteen minutes later, a woman who was taking a bus to work reported seeing a man holding a gun in front of a restaurant a few blocks away on Myrtle Avenue. 
 ''Officers responded to the location and saw the individual fitting the description there,'' said Mr. Kelly, referring to Mr. Givens. They drove up to Mr. Givens in a van. ''They shouted for the suspect to stop, but he fled eastbound on Myrtle Avenue.'' 
 The group of officers, who were all in street clothes, got out of the van and eventually fired six shots at Mr. Givens about two-thirds of the way down the block, the police said."

 The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago announced initiatives to improve the handling of sexual abuse accusations against priests. The archdiocese released the names of 55 priests who had had substantiated claims of abuse made against them since 1950. Officials have also hired a child welfare expert to train staff members on abuse reporting requirements and have improved reporting protocols with the authorities, said Jimmy M. Lago, chancellor of the archdiocese. A committee has also been appointed to help enact recommendations made in two independent audits. An audit conducted by a forensic investigation firm said a lack of communication among archdiocese departments had been the most significant failure in the handling of recent sexual abuse accusations against two priests.

"473","In Devils' Goal, a Disciple Is Idolized",1759551,"|sports",6,5,2006,"20060506T000000",NA," 
 As a teenager in Quebec, where his father was the Montreal Canadiens' team photographer, Martin Brodeur grew up in the shadows of the Montreal Forum idolizing Patrick Roy. 
 After spending the past dozen seasons as the Devils' No. 1 goaltender, Brodeur, who turns 34 on Saturday, has been around long enough to have become an idol in his own right. Just ask the Carolina Hurricanes' rookie goaltender Cam Ward, who said during a conference call this week that he idolized Brodeur as he was growing up in Alberta. 
 ''I was shaking my head when I heard that on TV,'' Brodeur said Friday before the Devils traveled to Raleigh, N.C., for Game 1 of their N.H.L. Eastern Conference semifinal series against Ward and the Hurricanes on Saturday afternoon. ''I said, 'Oh, no.' '' 
 Brodeur said that he used to laugh at his teammates when people approached them and told them how much they worshiped them. 
 ''And now it's happening to me,'' Brodeur said. ''But the guys are younger and they look up to the championship teams when they grew up, like I did when Patrick was there. And I was part of three of them.'' 
 Should Brodeur win a Stanley Cup championship this season, it would tie the four that Roy won with the Canadiens and the Colorado Avalanche. 
 By winning their final 11 games of the regular season, the Devils rallied to win the Atlantic Division and the third seeding in the Eastern Conference. Carolina, which won the Southeast Division, is seeded second. 
 No team in the playoffs is hotter than the Devils, who swept the Rangers, 4-0, in the first round. 
 With Brodeur leading the way, the Devils have won 15 consecutive games, equaling the second-longest winning streak in N.H.L. history. 
 Should the Devils win Games 1 and 2 against the Hurricanes, they would match the 17 games in a row the Pittsburgh Penguins won in 1992-93. 
 Should the Devils win Game 1, Brodeur would move into sole possession of third place in career playoff victories, behind only Roy and Grant Fuhr. 
 And it was Roy's records for regular-season victories (551) and playoff victories (151) that Brodeur said he would cherish most if he could break them. He has 446 regular-season victories and 88 playoff victories. 
 ''Winning is the most important thing to me,'' said Brodeur, who equaled his career high with a league-leading 43 victories in the regular season. 
 ''Goals against average, save percentage, shutouts -- they're great,'' he said. ''But at the end of the day, if you don't win these games, your team doesn't have any success. So I think for goalies, you have to look at the win totals to appreciate what the guy has done. 
 ''And if you have a lot of playoff wins, then you have a good chance of winning a lot of Stanley Cups.'' 
 When Brodeur hears his name mentioned in the same sentence as Roy, he said, it is mind-boggling to him. 
 ''He was the goalie for the Montreal Canadiens,'' Brodeur said. ''And as Canadians, it's a lot different than the kids in America or even the fans where everybody has my jersey now. Back when we grew up, when he started in '86, jerseys were not a big thing. For us, we idolized the Montreal Canadiens, and Patrick Roy was our guy. He was a young guy coming in having success in an all-English world. 
 ''And I started to know what hockey was all about when I went into the locker room in Montreal with my dad. When we spoke English, it was like, 'What's going on here? Everybody's French, no?' When you're young and you've never really left home, you don't know how it really works. So for us, it was a big deal that he was one of ours because we feel we're a small group in Canada as French people that have success in the big world, the N.H.L.'' 
 That feeling of kinship was why Brodeur said he idolized Roy. 
 Because they shared the same heritage, Brodeur said, he did not feel it was necessary to honor Roy, who wore No. 33, by wearing his number. 
 ''Or by wearing jerseys like kids do now,'' Brodeur said. 
 For a quick reminder of that, all he has to do Saturday is look toward the other crease, where Ward wears No. 30, just like Brodeur.

"474","The Least Affordable Place to Live? Try Salinas",1759890,"|real estate",7,5,2006,"20060507T000000","|California"," 
 IN 2005, the least-affordable place in the country to live, measured by the percentage of income devoted to mortgage payments, was Salinas, Calif. 
 The second was the Santa Cruz-Watsonville area of California. 
 The third? Santa Rosa-Petaluma, Calif. 
 In fact, California has the distinction of having the 11 least-affordable metropolitan areas in the country. One would need to go all the way down to 12th place -- and across the country to the New York region's northern suburbs -- to find a non-California metropolitan area on the least-affordable list of 2005. 
 Much of California is pretty. It has beaches and the mountains and, of course, the weather. But why are places like Salinas, which is surrounded by agriculture, topping places like Honolulu (No. 17) and Miami (No. 22) on the out-of-reach list? 
 There is no one answer, but demographers and public planners who study such trends say that a confluence of factors in California -- both artificial and natural -- have combined to create a particularly acute problem. 
 ''California has both political and geographical constraints on building,'' said Dowell Myers, professor of policy, planning and development at the University of Southern California. ''That drives up prices, and then it snowballs.'' 
 The geographical limits on developable land are the hills and the coast, while the political restrictions are state and local regulations that prevent building new homes, in response to both environmental and congestion concerns. 
 ''One of the key factors here is the basic law of supply and demand,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. ''California is in marked contrast to Florida, where you can expand without constraint. It's more like the New York suburbs, where too many dollars are chasing too few homes.'' 
 While many states have regulations on growth, California is a leader, Dean Hughes says. 
 California is also in the forefront of population growth, but it is not driven, as might be expected, by envious Easterners and Midwesterners escaping snowbound winters. Nor is it driven by long-term Californians. In fact, census figures show that over the past decade, more people have left California -- emigrating to neighboring states like Nevada and Arizona and farther away, to Texas and Florida -- than have moved in from other parts of the country. 
 The population increase is driven primarily by births and foreign immigration. According to census statistics, from April 2000 to July 2005, California experienced a net natural increase -- taking into account births and deaths -- of 1.5 million people. 
 And an additional 1.4 million moved in from other countries. 
 While California's birth rate is not the highest in the nation -- Utah's is -- it is near the top. 
 ''New York has the constraints but doesn't have the population growth,'' Professor Myers said. ''Florida has the population growth but doesn't have the constraints.'' 
 While it is difficult to build new houses in California, that isn't to say none are going up. According to the California Association of Realtors, there have been increases in the number of housing units built over the past nine years -- from 94,283 in 1996 to 207,154 in 2005. 
 That is substantially more than the low in 1993, when California was in the throes of a severe economic recession and only 84,656 units were built. But it's not as prolific as in 1988, when 255,559 went up. 
 There are a number of reasons for the restraints on home building, including the fact that many desirable areas in the state are already ''built out'' and the permit process is more complex and drawn out now than it was a few decades ago. 
 Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist for the Realtors group, said the state needs about 250,000 units a year to meet housing demand. ''We've been below that every year over the past 10 years,'' she said. 
 The high demand and low supply created a perfect breeding ground for investors and speculators, which became ''the last straw'' in driving housing prices up, said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. 
 Another quintessentially California issue is Proposition 13, the 1978 measure that slashed property taxes by more than 50 percent and ignited a national property tax revolution. 
 The measure, which was supposed to facilitate home buying, has backfired to some extent; local governments prefer that land be used for retailing rather than housing because they collect more from sales taxes than from property taxes. 
 ''Proposition 13 is a big stop sign saying 'no housing needed,' '' said Peter Dreier, professor of public policy at Occidental College in Los Angeles and an author of ''Place Matters: Metropolitics for the 21st Century'' (University Press of Kansas, 2001). ''Every municipality is engaged in a bidding war for retail -- they're battling for Wal-Mart, to keep the libraries open.'' 
 It is unlikely that will change, Professor Dreier and others say, calling Proposition 13 ''the third rail of government -- it's untouchable.'' 
 Although it is no surprise that house prices have gone through the roof in places like Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, what is more unexpected is that less-popular areas away from the coast are also topping the list of least-affordable places to live. 
 ''There's a huge movement away from L.A. County and from San Francisco and the great beneficiary is the Inland Empire'' in Southern California, and in Sacramento and points east in northern California, said William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. 
 The migration is happening both among high-skilled and middle-class residents, as well as low-skilled and lower-class ones, so the cost of housing is exploding even in areas of the state that most people do not think of as traditionally expensive, he said. 
 ''Baby boomers are getting older and moving into the higher-income bracket and into the top-dollar markets,'' Professor Myers said. ''Immigrants have high ownership rates at the bottom of the market. It's a recipe for a bubble.'' 
 These noncoastal communities are no longer simply attached to established cities, but in many cases have become job centers in their own right, Ms. Appleton-Young said. 
 The Inland Empire, made up of Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, has been in a 30-year transition from a bedroom suburb to a metropolitan area, she said. 
 ''People are now working where they live,'' Ms. Appleton-Young said. ''It's not a commuter area.'' 
 The San Joaquin Valley, in central California, on the other hand, still has a way to go to attract an educated work force and to create a diverse and thriving economy. But Ms. Appleton-Young said it appears to be following in the footsteps of the Inland Empire: ''As we say, jobs follow housing.'' 
 The final paradox in this state of paradoxes is that traditionally, many Californians are not homeowners; the state ranks 48th, behind only New York and Hawaii, in terms of homeownership, and about 10 percent below the national average. But over the past several years, even as housing prices have increased, more people are buying. 
 Home sales climbed fairly steadily from 1996 through 2005, with only a slight downward blip in 2001, said the California Realtors' association. 
 Hans Johnson, a demographer with the nonprofit Public Policy Institute of California, said, ''It's counterintuitive.'' But apparently typical. Those familiar with home-purchasing trends say that people buy when the market is going up, not when it is going down. 
 If houses are so costly, how are people managing to make the leap and become homeowners? 
 In some cases, they use methods of financing that were not previously available, Mr. Johnson said. Instead of fixed-rate 30-year mortgages, they take, for example, variable-rate interest-only loans, which have lower monthly payments. 
 In many cases, he said, homeowners are paying far more on mortgages than the 30 percent of income recommended by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
 A study by the Public Policy Institute of California found that 40 percent of all households in California, the most anywhere, exceeded this recommended threshold. ''In some cases, they're even paying more than half,'' Mr. Johnson said. 
 New homeowners are buying smaller homes or condominiums; according to the study, only 15 percent of long-term homeowners in California live in multifamily housing units, like condominiums, while 26 percent of recent buyers do. 
 ''In some ways it's good, because people own a house and have equity,'' he said. ''In other ways it's bad,'' he explained, because ''if interest rates go up, there will be a large increase in monthly rates.'' 
 ''If there's a bubble that bursts or slowly leaks,'' he added, overextended owners may not be able to sell and recover enough to pay off the loan. 
 Professor Dreier of Occidental College said he also blamed state government and business leaders for failing to support the creation of moderate-priced housing -- not just for low-income residents, but also for middle-class people, like teachers and nurses, who cannot buy into the overheated housing market. 
 When he was a city official in Boston, the state government, businessmen and bankers ''understood that affordable housing was part of a healthy work force,'' Professor Dreier said. ''In California, businesses and the Chambers of Commerce have not embraced housing issues like they have embraced other issues, such as health care. We won't see the political will to solve the housing crisis until the organized business community weighs in and says it's unacceptable.'' 
 The big question now is whether the housing market will deflate while the economy stays strong, which would enable more Californians to buy. The answer seems as elusive as predicting the next earthquake. 
 The signs point toward a slowdown: interest rates are going up, and investors and speculators, who drove up prices by buying and selling houses, seem to be pulling back in hot markets nationally. But everyone, even those who study the subject, knows it is dangerous to predict. 
 Ask Professor Myers of U.S.C., who sold his house in Los Angeles last year. ''I was convinced it was going to peak,'' he said. ''After I sold, it rose another 15 percent.''"

"476","To Save a Shorebird, Horseshoe Crabbing Is Banned in New Jersey",1762074,"|new york|region",16,5,2006,"20060516T000000","|New Jersey|New Jersey"," 
 In an effort to save a wide-ranging shorebird from extinction, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has banned all fishing of horseshoe crabs, the bird's main food source, for the next two years. The moratorium, put in place yesterday, affects about 30 commercial fishermen in New Jersey. 
 The red knot, a robin-size bird that the state has listed as threatened, migrates annually from Tierra del Fuego, at the southern tip of South America, to the Canadian Arctic. When flying north from Brazil, the birds make only one stop, along the Delaware Bay, where they eat enough protein- and fat-rich horseshoe crab eggs to double their weight. Then the birds take off for the last leg of their 10,000 mile journey, a nonstop flight north to Southampton Island in Canada, just below the Arctic Circle. 
 In 1998, about 50,360 birds made the journey. But by 2004, after a large increase in the horseshoe crab harvest during the 1990's, only 13,315 birds were counted. Last year about 17,000 landed on the shores of Delaware Bay. Some scientists estimate that the birds could become extinct in five years. 
 ''New Jersey has taken the position that we're going to do everything we can, everything within our authority, to make sure that doesn't happen,'' said John Watson, deputy commissioner of the state's Department of Environmental Protection. 
 But last week, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, which coordinates the management of ocean resources in the 15 Atlantic coast states, stopped short of imposing a regionwide moratorium on horseshoe crabbing. The commission instead limited the harvesting of the crabs during the spring breeding season in some states. 
 Fishermen in New York are allowed to take up to 366,000 crabs, but took only 142,279 in 2004, according to the commission. In Connecticut, where crabbers were allowed to take 48,689 crabs, they took 23,788 in 2004. 
 A bill in the New Jersey Assembly's Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee calls for a moratorium on horseshoe crabbing that would last until the red knot population reached 240,000 and the supply of crab eggs returned to a level that could sustain them. The bill also seeks to appropriate $168,300 to compensate licensed harvesters of horseshoe crabs and eggs, based on their harvests three years ago. 
 Eric Stiles, vice president for conservation at the New Jersey Audubon Society, said that the shorebird migration generated at least $15.9 million in tourism for New Jersey in 1998, and from 1996 to 2001, wildlife-related recreation grew 43 percent. ''We're looking at an industry that's exploding in New Jersey,'' he said. Meanwhile, he added, the conch and eel fisheries, which use horseshoe crabs for bait, are in decline. 
 Scot C. Mackey, a lobbyist for the Garden State Seafood Association, said 32 or 33 fishermen still have commercial licenses to catch horseshoe crabs. He said he was disappointed with the state's moratorium, and would have liked to have seen the state allow the harvesting of male crabs. Compensating the fishermen for their lost harvests would not help conch fishermen, who use the horseshoe crabs for bait, he said."
"477","A Quick Course in the Economics of Confusion",1765012,"|business",28,5,2006,"20060528T000000",NA," 
 MY nephew, Jonathan, a historian, likes to make a humorous toast that was heard at George Washington's dinner table during the Revolutionary War. It goes simply, ''Confusion to the British.'' 
 Of course, we now love the British; in fact, we have for a long time. But the toast that we seem to be making to ourselves these days is simpler, on both sides of the aisle: 
 ''Confusion to ourselves.'' 
 On the Democratic and Republican-in-Name-Only side, we have the idea of ''windfall profits taxes'' on energy companies. These would presumably mandate a desirable level of corporate profits in one sector on which we depend. (And how long do you think it would apply to only one industry?) If profits exceeded that level, they would be taxed. 
 As far as I can tell, there is no plan to give a rebate to the companies if their profits have fallen below that desired level. 
 In other words, the plan is to send this message to energy-company investors, including retirees and pension funds: ''Yes, we are in a situation of oil and gas shortage. Yes, we want you to risk billions of dollars exploring for and producing and refining oil and processing gas. But if you succeed for any reason, and even if no price-fixing is found, we will punish you for it.'' 
 This is what I would call confusion. You usually get more of something by rewarding people for doing it or producing it, not by punishing them for doing it or producing it. 
 Yes, the human instinct of envy demands that we get some licks in against people who are doing well, even if we are doing only slightly less well ourselves. But economies built on the politics of envy are rarely successful. Ask the Cambodians or the Chinese or the Russians before they went capitalist. 
 On the right side of the aisle, there is breathtaking confusion about supply-side economics. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow has been touring the money programs on television, touting the effects of the Bush tax cuts on federal revenues, ''explaining,'' as one might say, that this proves that supply-side theory really does work and you really can get something for nothing. He is partly right, in the same sense that you could borrow a bit more than $4 trillion to buy stocks and then tell people you are worth $4 trillion -- if you don't count the money you owed. 
 Supply side has a genesis in respectability that comes largely from my idol, the Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago. Professor Friedman said that if we cut taxes, government would be kept from being so big and intrusive and such a threat to civil liberties. That makes sense if you have a government of responsible adults. (Alas, we don't.) 
 Then along came another friend, Arthur Laffer, a likable and intelligent man who, with no substantial backup at all in data that I am aware of, said that if you cut taxes on income, you would stimulate so much economic activity that you would collect as much in tax as you did when rates were higher. 
 Note that this was actually a supposed refinement on Keynesian economics, which indeed predicted economic growth if you cut taxes and ran a deficit because government would spend at a higher rate than consumers. (This is wildly oversimplified, and I apologize for that.) John Maynard Keynes also did not have a lot of data for his theories, but they appealed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, so they were tried on a tiny scale during the Depression. 
 Did they work? They did not work in the Depression, probably because the scale of the deficits was far too small. But they worked like gangbusters in World War II, when federal deficits were running roughly 40 percent of gross national product and the economy was exploding with growth. 
 What we saw in the years of President Ronald Reagan -- and now President Bush -- was not in any sense a vindication of the genius Professor Friedman or the persuasive and charming Mr. Laffer. 
 Cutting taxes has not produced the federal spending cuts that Professor Friedman was hoping for. Not even close. Federal spending as a percentage of G.N.P. barely changed under President Reagan. The gusher of income tax receipts that was promised to shrink the deficit to as low or lower than the level before the tax cuts didn't happen, either. 
 Indeed, under my pal Mr. Bush, whom I still love and admire despite his human flaws, government spending has risen as income tax receipts have fallen. (The missing responsible adults again, perhaps.) Five years into a recovery, income tax receipts are still lower than they were in merry President Bill Clinton's last year at the helm. (Corporate profits receipts have risen.) 
 We have deficits such as have never been dreamed of in the absence of a world war, with more than $2 trillion added to the total national debt since 2001. And all that borrowing and spending has worked as Keynes guessed they might. 
 YES, we do have a very strong economy by many metrics -- alas, not including personal hourly income, but that's for another day. We have full employment and stupendous corporate profits. We even have a labor shortage. 
 But this is not a redemption of supply side theory, which promised growth that was enough to cause tax receipts to rise. It is a redemption of old-fashioned Keynesianism. 
 As it turned out, Mr. Reagan and the current president were and are the real Keynesian disciples, not F.D.R. or any other Democrat. The Republicans turn out to be the party of Keynes, as President Richard M. Nixon long ago acknowledged when he famously declared in 1971: ''Now I am a Keynesian.'' 
 Supply side is fun in the same way it's fun to rationalize spending as if it were saving, and in the same way any theory is fun when it says that the easier, softer way is better than the hard way. But it doesn't work, or at least it hasn't worked yet. 
 ''Tax and spend'' was the old way, but people did not like to be taxed. The new way seems to be ''don't tax, but keep spending and things will be fine.'' 
 Wouldn't it be pretty if it were true?

"478","After $38 Million Last Year, the Pay Is Not an Issue",1765662,"|business",31,5,2006,"20060531T000000",NA," 
 Henry M. Paulson Jr. took home more than $38 million last year as the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs. If the Senate confirms him as the next Treasury secretary, he will collect a mere $183,500 in annual pay -- not much more than a junior investment banker makes. 
 Not that it matters. In his 32-year career at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Paulson has accumulated a $700 million equity stake in the Wall Street firm. 
 Government ethics rules will probably force him to give up his authority over most of that vast fortune, which is far more than other Goldman Sachs executives who preceded him to Washington have accumulated. This includes Robert E. Rubin, whose net worth was less than $100 million when he gave up the Goldman chairmanship in 1993 to join the new Clinton administration. 
 The huge difference between his and Mr. Paulson's $700 million net worth reflects not only Mr. Paulson's success at managing Goldman Sachs after the firm's 1999 initial public offering, but also the sheer magnitude of money paid to top executives on Wall Street today. 
 History has shown that the Treasury secretary is typically called upon to give up control of investments in companies that may present a conflict of interest. In 2001, former Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill grudgingly agreed to sell about $100 million worth of Alcoa stock and options, bowing to pressure from public watchdog groups who criticized his initial plans to retain his holdings and recuse himself from all decisions related to the company. 
 But Alcoa is an aluminum company. Shares of a securities firm such as Goldman Sachs, whose trading desks and financial tentacles stretch across the globe, would present a far more obvious conflict with the role of Treasury secretary. ''Considering how every word that man speaks affects financial markets, he can't have control of anything,'' said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonpartisan legal watchdog group. 
 Mr. Paulson, no stranger to managing conflicts of interest, is taking steps to sever financial ties before seeking Senate confirmation. ''He is expected to 'ring fence' his assets so that he will have no influence on how they are managed,'' said Lucas van Praag, a Goldman Sachs spokesman. ''He is taking independent legal advice but the determination as to what he will do has yet to be made.'' 
 Mr. van Praag said that if Mr. Paulson set up a blind trust to shield him from any knowledge about his investments, Goldman Sachs would not be the trustee. 
 Unwinding his personal fortune, however, may not be as difficult as it seems. Mr. Paulson recently set aside $100 million of Goldman stock for a family foundation dedicated to conservation and environmental education, and has said privately that he planned to give away even more of his wealth. 
 Mr. Paulson has about $630 million in Goldman stock and vested options, based on estimates from the latest regulatory filings and yesterday's $149.89 closing price. And thanks to a somewhat unusual clause in the investment bank's equity award program, stock and stock options for employees who resign to join a government agency or self-regulatory organization vest on an accelerated track, instead of being lost. The result is that Mr. Paulson would receive another $70 million in options. 
 ''Does that give him a short-term windfall? Yeah,'' said Brian J. Foley, an executive compensation consultant in White Plains. ''But every month he is working as Treasury secretary, he is losing money by not working at Goldman Sachs.'' 
 Mr. Paulson is the latest in a long line of Goldman executives to take top jobs in Washington. In 1993, Mr. Rubin gave up his role as chairman of Goldman Sachs, then a private partnership, to join the Clinton administration as a top economic adviser. He was named Treasury secretary two years later. 
 At the time, Mr. Rubin was reported to have an estimated net worth of $50 million to $100 million. In today's dollars, that would be $65 million to $130 million. 
 To avoid potential conflicts, Mr. Rubin cut financial ties with his former firm and set up a blind trust. He then purchased a special insurance policy guaranteeing that the value of his stake would be preserved, should anything happen to Goldman. 
 Other former Goldman partners took similar measures before they began high-profile stints in Washington, including Jon S. Corzine, the former Democratic senator from New Jersey and now that state's governor. Mr. Corzine, whose $400 million Goldman Sachs fortune helped bankroll his 2000 Senate campaign, vowed to sell his remaining Goldman shares after public watchdogs suggested the equity stake conflicted with his role as a member of the Senate Banking Committee. He set up a blind trust, and through it sold all his Goldman shares by September 2005. 
 Some business leaders have taken similar steps, also sometimes under pressure, to avoid conflicts in Washington. Vice President Dick Cheney collected more than $20 million after cashing out options from Halliburton, where he served as chairman and chief executive, once his finances became an issue during the 2000 presidential campaign. John W. Snow, the former CSX chairman and chief executive, agreed to give up corporate directorships and to sell more than $20 million worth of stocks and bonds before succeeding Mr. O'Neill in February 2003. 
 A CHANGE AT TREASURY: THE COMPENSATION"
"479","Japan Inquiry Into Accident Could Tarnish Toyota Image",1775643,"|business",13,7,2006,"20060713T000000","|Japan"," 
 An investigation by the local Japanese police into an accident involving a Toyota sport utility vehicle threatens to turn into an embarrassing scandal for the carmaker, which has built its success on a reputation for reliability. 
 On Tuesday, the police in Kumamoto, a small city in southern Japan, accused Toyota of failing to recall the type of S.U.V. involved in an accident in 2004 that injured a family of five, despite having known for years of a fault in the steering assembly. Toyota started issuing recalls for the vehicle, called a Hilux Surf in Japan and a 4Runner in the United States, two months after the accident. 
 The police asked local prosecutors to investigate three current and former executives in Toyota's head office for possible negligence in their decision not to issue the recall earlier, or to take other safety measures, said Akitoshi Takahashi, an officer in the city police traffic division. He refused to identify the three, but said prosecutors were reviewing the request before deciding whether to file charges. The Kumamoto district prosecutor's office declined to comment. 
 Toyota discovered the design flaw in 1996, after customer complaints prompted an internal inquiry, but decided that the problem was not big enough to merit a recall, a spokesman, Paul Nolasco, said. It issued a statement on Tuesday saying it believed that the ''three individuals concerned addressed the matter appropriately,'' but also promised to cooperate with the investigation and to strengthen its quality control. 
 Still, ''Toyota views this as a serious case and a serious accusation,'' Mr. Nolasco added. 
 Analysts said the accusation was unlikely to grow into a big enough problem to derail Toyota's push to overtake General Motors and become the world's largest carmaker. But they said that the failure to disclose the flaw promptly and fix it was an embarrassing misstep for the company. The analysts also recalled the troubles at another Japanese vehicle manufacturer, the truck and bus maker Mitsubishi Fuso. Its sales dropped two years ago after the authorities concluded that it had covered up a defective front axle that led to the death of a pedestrian. 
 ''Mitsubishi's brand suffered for a long time as a result of the negative publicity,'' said Koichi Sugimoto, an analyst at Nomura Securities in Tokyo. ''The risk for Toyota is that this incident becomes the same sort of public issue.'' 
 Mr. Sugimoto said he thought that Toyota would be more successful at damage control than Mitsubishi, partly because it had already recalled the vehicles in question and because Mitsubishi's problems were more widespread. 
 Still, Toyota's image has started to take a battering in Japan, where the police accusation was a top item in Wednesday's newspapers. The effect was particularly acute because Toyota has become a source of national pride here for its success in besting Detroit. 
 ''A life-threatening flaw,'' a headline in Tokyo Shimbun read. ''Has the world leader grown smug?'' 
 Toyota said the defect was in a part of the steering assembly, the relay rod, which Toyota said was prone to bending. The company said a rising number of customer complaints had already prompted it to begin reconsidering whether to issue a recall when the accident in Kumamoto happened in August 2004. 
 In the accident, a sudden steering problem caused a Hilux Surf to swerve into oncoming traffic and strike another vehicle, Toyota and the police said. The driver of the Hilux Surf was unharmed, but all five members of the family traveling in the other vehicle, including three children, were injured, some seriously. 
 Two months later, Toyota recalled the Hilux Surf and two pickup truck models that used a similar steering assembly, the T100 and the Hilux, as the Tacoma pickup truck in the United States. Toyota recalled affected models including the 4Runner in the United States in September 2005, Mr. Nolasco said.

"480","Furs Hit, Too, as Sales Tax Increase Kicks In",1776307,"|education|new york|region",16,7,2006,"20060716T000000","|New Jersey|Newark (NJ)"," 
 ACROSS New Jersey this weekend, shoppers and business owners face the rudest of awakenings when a 1 percent increase in the sales tax -- the fulcrum of the recent government shutdown -- takes effect. 
 But the adjustment may be even more jarring for the state's furriers. Nine months ago, they were told that they no longer had to collect sales taxes at all, but the state budget signed last weekend includes a provision for a new ''Fur Clothing Gross Receipts Tax.'' 
 Like the sales tax, this surcharge on fur goods was taking effect Saturday morning. But while the sales tax rises to 7 percent from 6 percent, the gross receipts levy on furs is 6 percent. 
 That was of small solace to New Jersey furriers. ''That's terrible,'' said Teli Natsis, whose family owns the Fur Outlet in Englishtown, when told that the tax was kicking in. ''We just stopped paying taxes.'' 
 Furriers were included in an effort to streamline sales tax rules last October. The change was designed to bring fur items -- which were taxed -- in line with the rules for other clothing, which were not taxed. 
 In the scramble to find additional revenue in the past few weeks, lawmakers turned their eye again toward furs. The state expects to bring in about $5 million from the fur tax. Clothing will still be tax exempt. 
 It is not the last new levy. In October, the sales tax will be extended to things like magazines and security services.

 In New York, every president or visiting prime minister rides around in a limousine or a sport utility vehicle, trailed by security guys who have little plastic coils that run up their necks to little earphones that stick out of their ears. George H. W. Bush. Bill Clinton. Tony Blair. Albert Pintat. 
 Yes, Albert Pintat, the prime minister of Andorra, an amoeba-shaped principality between France and Spain with 75,000 citizens, half as many as Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and less than 1 percent of the population of New York City. 
 Mr. Pintat's country is income tax-free and limousine-free. When he goes places in Andorra's one city, he drives himself, if he does not simply walk. He has no security detail, no entourage. 
 The way Mr. Pintat describes Andorra, it sounds like a place created not by Charlemagne, as legend and the national anthem have it, but by Garrison Keillor. ''The world forgot us,'' he says, cheerfully. 
 How different his weeklong visit to New York has been from a week at home. Since he arrived to attend the opening session this week of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Pintat has not been in the driver's seat once. He has not had to learn the New York driver's alphabet: the B.Q.E., the F.D.R., C.P.W. 
 Nor has he had to figure out such New York driving rituals as alternate-side parking, for he has been just another leader in the back seat of just another limousine creeping toward the United Nations. 
 And he has been trailed by American Secret Service agents. They ride in elevators with him. They cool their heels when he decides, as he did on Wednesday afternoon, to stop by the Andorran mission and work on ''the speech.'' For his week was focused on ''the speech,'' which he delivered yesterday afternoon from the same lectern at which President Bush spoke one day and President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela called him ''the devil'' the next. 
 There was also the reception, which is a diplomatic must when heads of state are in town. Little Andorra drew a big crowd: more than 75 people shook Mr. Pintat's hand as they moved through his receiving line at the Millennium U.N. Plaza Hotel, across First Avenue from the United Nations. 
 As lower-level diplomats from other nations swirled through the crowded room, Ambassador Ravan Farhadi of Afghanistan leaned against the piano. Across the room, sipping a glass of water, Mr. Pintat talked about how comfortable he felt in New York. 
 ''I was always impressed with what is written under the liberty lady -- here you are welcome,'' he said. And with so many leaders in New York at once, he said, ''you can speak with Montenegro, with Switzerland, with Iceland. All your friends, you can see them here.'' 
 He does not mind being the smallest of players on the world stage. ''We do not want to join the E.U.,'' he said, referring to the European Union. 
 Andorra has been working to shake off a reputation as the dowdy laughingstock of the Pyrenees, as a tax refuge mentioned in the same breath as Monaco or Liechtenstein and as a front for swindlers on eBay who are based elsewhere. 
 Mr. Pintat said Andorra had been going through an ''economic evolution.'' Parliament has been considering a corporate tax, but not a personal income tax. ''You don't need that much taxation,'' he said. 
 Mr. Pintat mentioned that Andorra had the world's lowest unemployment rate (zero). Encyclopedias and almanacs add details that he did not: Andorrans have the world's longest life expectancy (83 1/2 years). Andorra has no navy -- it is, after all, landlocked, although it has dozens of mountain lakes -- and it has no army, either. Until 1993, it had a law requiring every household to keep a firearm that could be used to defend the country, said Joseph Altarriba, an aide who accompanied Mr. Pintat to New York. 
 Officially, Andorra was at war with Germany until the 1950's. (Andorra was mistakenly left out of the Versailles treaty that ended World War I.) 
 These days, Andorrans spend euros -- Andorra does not have its own currency, and it has been known as a place that appeals to rich foreigners who want to avoid taxes. 
 In 2002, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development put the country on its list of uncooperative tax havens. But Mr. Pintat, who has been prime minister since May 2005, said Andorra was not like that. 
 ''We don't go in for offshore business or tax evasion,'' he said. In fact, he said, foreign business interests can own only a third of an Andorran-based company. Andorrans must own the rest. 
 Still, he said, the corporate tax law would go a long way toward redeeming Andorra's reputation. ''After 9/11, you have to prove you are clean,'' he said. ''We thought, being a small country, we didn't have to show our wallet.''"
"483","Aiming to Be the Truck of Patriots",1792888,"|business",26,9,2006,"20060926T000000",NA," 
 When the new Chevrolet Silverado pickups begin rolling out of factories this fall, they will have stronger frames, more fuel-efficient engines and a metaphorical American flag in the rear window. 
 Starting this weekend, General Motors will run ads that tap into patriotism. The same brand that likened itself to baseball, hot dogs and apple pie in commercials in the 1970's now hopes to kindle the same feelings by positioning the Silverado as America's truck. 
 No longer is the Silverado ''like a rock,'' as Bob Seger insisted for years. Chevy has enlisted singer John Mellencamp, whose soon-to-be-released anthem ''Our Country'' will be the background of the new campaign. 
 The first of the ads is filled with images of historic moments in recent American history -- Rosa Parks on the bus, Martin Luther King speaking, the aftermath of Sept. 11, Hurricane Katrina's devastation -- and ends with the tagline: ''This is our country. This is our truck.'' 
 To be sure, the campaign includes the obligatory boasts of brute strength and toughness. But the new ads show that in an increasingly crowded market, G.M. feels the need to connect with truck lovers in a more emotional way. 
 ''Our goal is to own the hearts of the American pickup buyer,'' said Kim Kosak, G.M.'s general director of advertising and sales promotions. 
 Another goal -- and a more pressing one -- is to ward off Japanese rivals who have made inroads in the full-size pickup truck market, the last bastion of the American automakers. 
 This fall, Toyota is introducing a retooled version of its Tundra pickup, a model seen as a significant threat to the segment's long-established leaders, the Silverado, the top-selling model at G.M., and the F-150, the top seller at Ford. 
 Pickups are critical to the turnaround efforts at both G.M. and the Ford Motor Company, not only because of their popularity but because the profit margins they carry are many times those of passenger cars. 
 ''G.M.'s full-size pickup line is the single largest contributor to the company's profitability,'' said John Casesa, an automotive analyst and managing partner of Casesa Strategic Advisers in New York. ''It's the backbone of the company's North American business. It makes a real difference if sales are up or down 5 percent.'' 
 Detroit's automakers have long encouraged consumers to ''buy American,'' perhaps most famously through Chrysler's gregarious former chairman, Lee Iacocca. The Big Three carmakers' falling market share may be a sign that the buy American sentiment is fading. 
 But pickup buyers are different from other car shoppers. A majority of trucks are purchased to be used on the job, and their drivers cannot easily downsize to more fuel-efficient cars to follow the example of people who abandoned sport utility vehicles when gasoline prices rose to $3 a gallon. 
 Urging consumers to buy American ''has never worked in any other segment of the vehicle market, so ultimately I don't know that it will work here,'' Mr. Casesa said. ''But if there's any segment in which the American appeal would work, this is it.'' 
 Foreign carmakers have been less successful at selling trucks because pickups are largely unpopular outside the United States, and satisfaction with American trucks remains high. 
 G.M. maintains that market research it conducted in developing its new campaign showed there is a strong sentiment toward American-made trucks, even in cities on the East and West Coasts where foreign cars are most common. 
 ''They want to buy an American truck, because they feel Americans still make better pickups than anyone on the market, because they consider us the truck experts,'' Ms. Kosak said. 
 Gary Pascoe, executive vice president of Campbell-Ewald, the agency behind the Silverado campaign, said: ''No other country can build this truck -- not Korea, not Japan, not Germany. It is a pure reflection of the American experience.'' 
 Patriotic themes are not new for G.M., which offered a ''Keep America Rolling'' promotion in the months after the 2001 terrorist attacks. Chevy has at various times claimed to be ''an American revolution'' and ''the heartbeat of America'' since its ''baseball, hot dogs, apple pie and Chevrolet'' ads, which were revived briefly this past summer. 
 Similar themes can be seen at Ford, which uses ''Red, White and Bold'' as a rallying cry for its employees and has declared itself to be ''America's car company.'' 
 G.M.'s attempt to make the Silverado the country's unofficial pickup will not go unchallenged by Ford, whose F-150 has been the best-selling vehicle in the United States for 30 years. 
 ''Our strategy is to act like leaders and not posture about leadership,'' said a Ford spokesman, Jim Cain. ''That means an intense focus on the customer, regular investment in the product and innovation. I think our track record on all those fronts speaks for itself.'' 
 In 2005, Ford sold about 901,000 F-150's to Chevy's 706,000 Silverados. G.M. also sold 229,000 of its GMC Sierra, a more luxurious version of the Silverado. 
 The new Silverado and Sierra are scheduled to arrive at dealerships next month. They will be shown publicly for the first time Wednesday at the State Fair of Texas. (As proof of how important Texas is for pickup sales, the campaign will feature a television spot created specifically to run in Texas.) 
 The first national television spot is scheduled to run this Saturday during ABC's college football broadcasts. Chevy is also sponsoring NBC's Sunday night N.F.L. broadcast with a 90-second introduction asserting that the Silverado is as uniquely American as football. 
 More ads will begin running Oct. 21, during the first game of the World Series. Those spots continue the ''Our Country, Our Truck'' theme, showing the truck's target buyers -- active men -- at work and at play. ''This is our breakfast,'' one spot says as a forklift snares piles of lumber. ''This is our chat room,'' it continues as two men relax at a rural coffee shop. 
 A separate parallel campaign aimed at Hispanic audiences will run simultaneously, although G.M. did not reveal specifics Monday. 
 G.M.'s flag-waving Silverado campaign contrasts sharply with another recent ad blitz from one of its competitors. The Chrysler Group, a division of DaimlerChrysler, highlighted its German ties in a series of quirky, endlessly repeated spots featuring the company's chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, under the nickname ''Dr. Z.'' 
 Those ads were pulled after they failed to reach sales goals, although the company said they could return someday.

In ''Word Power Made Easy,'' he assures the reader, ''When you have finished working with this book, you will no longer be the same person.'' 
 A longtime faculty member at Rio Hondo College in Whittier, Mr. Lewis formerly taught at New York University and the City College of New York. 
 In the dozens of books he wrote or edited, Mr. Lewis initiated readers into mysteries like the meaning of ''mulct'' (to bilk, tax or punish by fine); the difference between an anthropologist and a polyandrist; and the wisdom, or lack thereof, of using a preposition to end a sentence with. 
 One of his books lists more than 100 ''esoteric phobias,'' among them aichmophobia, cibophobia, chionophobia, climacophobia, gymnophobia, harpaxophobia, maieusiophobia, peniaphobia, pnigerophobia, scelerophobia and taeniophobia. 
 Much of Mr. Lewis's work is still in print, including ''Word Power Made Easy'' (Pocket Books, 1979); ''30 Days to Better English'' (Signet, 1985); and ''30 Days to a More Powerful Vocabulary'' (Pocket Books, 1971), written with Wilfred Funk. Mr. Lewis also edited several editions of Roget's Thesaurus, including The New Roget's Thesaurus in Dictionary Form (Berkley, 1976). 
 Norman Lewis was born in Brooklyn on Dec. 30, 1912, and earned degrees from City College and Columbia. He joined the Rio Hondo faculty in 1964. 
 Besides his daughter Debbie of Los Angeles, Mr. Lewis is survived by his wife, the former Mary Goldstein; another daughter, Margie of Whittier; two grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. 
 Mr. Lewis's phobias, from ''Word Power Made Easy,'' are, respectively, fear of pointed objects, food, snow, stairs, nakedness, robbers, childbirth, poverty, smothering, burglars and tapeworms."

 NO one blinks when a celebrity is called ''vacuous'' or a politician a ''moron'' -- but when headlines screamed that dolphins are ''dimwits'' and ''flippin' idiots,'' I was truly shocked. Is this a way to talk about an animal so revered that there are several Web domain names that include ''smart dolphin''? 
 This is not to say that one should believe everything about them. For example, their supposed ''smile'' is fake (they lack the facial musculature for expressions), and all we seem to have learned from chatting ''dolphinese'' with them is that lone male dolphins are keenly interested in female researchers. 
 Nevertheless, it's going too far to say that dolphins are dimwits. Yet this is the claim of Paul Manger, a South African scientist who says that dolphins' relatively large brains are due simply to preponderance of fatty glial cells. These glia produce heat, which allows the brain's neurons to do their job in the cold ocean. 
 Based on this observation, Professor Manger couldn't resist speculating that the intelligence of dolphins and other cetaceans (like whales and porpoises) is vastly overrated. He offered gems of insight, such as that dolphins are too stupid to jump over a slight barrier (as when they are trapped in a tuna net), whereas most other animals will. Even a goldfish will jump out of its bowl, he noted. 
 If we skip the technicalities -- such as that glial cells are not simply insulation, that they add connectivity to the brain, and that humans, too, have many more glial cells than neurons -- the question remains why the prospect of animal intelligence sets off such controversy. Could it be that the huge size of the dolphin brain, which exceeds ours by 15 percent or more, threatens the human ego? Are we to ignore the billions and billions of neurons that dolphins do possess? 
 The goldfish remark reminded me of a common strategy of those who play down animal intelligence. They love to ''demonstrate'' remarkable cognitive feats in small-brained species: if a rat or pigeon can do it, it can't be that special. Thus, some pigeons have been trained to use ''symbolic communication'' by pecking a key marked ''thank you!'' that delivered food to another pigeon. And they have also been conditioned to peck at their own bodies in front of a mirror, supporting the claim that they are ''self-aware.'' 
 Clearly, pigeons are trainable. But is this truly comparable to the actions of Presley, a dolphin at the New York Aquarium, who, without any rewards, reacted to being marked with paint by taking off at high speed to a distant part of his tank where a mirror was mounted? There he spun round and round, the way we do in a dressing room, appearing to check himself out. 
 What is so upsetting to some people about the closeness between animal and human intelligence, or between animal and human emotions, for that matter? Just saying that animals can learn from each other, and hence have rudimentary cultures, or that they can be jealous or empathic is taken by some as a personal affront. Accusations of anthropomorphism will fly, and we'll be urged to be parsimonious in our explanations. The message is that animals are no humans. 
 That much is obvious. But it is equally true that humans are animals. Is it so outlandish, from an evolutionary standpoint, to assume that if a large-brained mammal acts similarly to us under similar circumstances, the psychology behind its behavior is probably similar, too? This is true parsimony in the scientific sense, the idea that the simplest explanation is often the best. Those who resist this framework are in ''anthropodenial'' -- they cling to unproven differences. 
 Since Aristotle, humans have known that dolphins are incredibly social. Each individual produces its own unique whistle sound by which the others recognize him or her. They enjoy lifelong bonds and reconcile after fights by means of ''petting.'' The males form power-seeking coalitions, not unlike the politics of chimpanzees and humans. Dolphins also support sick companions near the surface, where they can breathe. They may encircle a school of herring, driving the fish together in a compact ball and releasing bubbles to keep them in place, after which they pick their food like fruit from a tree. 
 In captivity, dolphins are known to imitate the gait and gestures of people walking by, and to outsmart their keepers. One female dolphin that was rewarded with a fish for every piece of debris she managed to collect from her tank managed to con her trainers into a bounty of snacks. They discovered she had been hiding large items like newspapers underwater, only to rip small pieces from them, bringing these to her trainer one by one. 
 There are tons of such observations, which is why most of us believe in dolphin intelligence -- glia or no glia. It also explains why the slaughter of dolphins, as still occurs every year in Japan, arouses such strong emotions and controversy. 
 Still, I must admit that the whole dolphin affair has also offered me some fresh insights. From now on, if I find my goldfish thrashing on the floor, I will congratulate him before dropping him back into his bowl.

 GOD bless Mel Gibson. 
 Of course, the deity doing the blessing is less likely to be Yahweh than Gukumatz, traditional Toltec god of culture, agriculture and opening weekend grosses. 
 By now the miracles have been quantified. ''Apocalypto,'' when it opened, promptly took the top box office spot with $15 million. Plus -- what are the odds? -- his Joseph Campbell-meets-Mesoamerica epic has been nominated for a Golden Globe, and is now being mentioned in the same sentence as Oscar. 
 It's the last thing you'd expect for a movie in Mayan -- especially one made by a man whose last project was a staging of Hate Crime Theater on a Malibu police-cam. Which begs the question: How low does a human being have to sink before Hollywood shoos him away and he can't get an Oscar? 
 Stars have always been bent. Wallace Reid, the silent screen's first heartthrob -- and a full-on dope fiend -- needed the studio to slip him morphine to keep production going. (This was the pre-rehab era; Reid died trying to kick his habit in a sanitarium.) 
 The celebrated Charlie Chaplin? In his 20s, he married a 16-year-old moppet; in his 30s, married another 16-year-old; in his 50s, settled down with a 17-year-old. But his penchant for child brides did not prevent him from receiving the longest standing ovation in Oscar history when he was given an honorary statue in 1972. Of course, Chaplin's honor also marked his return from exile in Switzerland. 
 Once, Hollywood required scandal-ridden stars to go away for a while -- a penitent hiatus before they could enjoy redemption, their second acts. So after being banished for years for her baby with Roberto Rossellini, Ingrid Bergman was, in 1956, finally welcomed back and given an Oscar. 
 Roman Polanski waited decades after fleeing a warrant for pedophilia before he finally snagged, in absentia, his best director statue for ''The Pianist.'' And even Leni Riefenstahl, the Führer's darling, received a posthumous mention among the notable Hollywood dead at the 2003 Oscars. 
 But less than five months have passed between Mr. Gibson's spouting of tequila-fueled bons mots on the dread power of the Hebrews and his basking in the glow of a No. 1 movie. His brief time in the wilderness may represent the fastest about-face since Democrats re-embraced Joseph Lieberman after he bested Ned Lamont in the Connecticut Senate race. 
 I know what you're going to say: Fatty Arbuckle. The exception to the rule. Once bigger than Chaplin, he's now remembered as the gold standard of degraded celebrity, someone who allegedly committed such unforgivable acts that he could never really come back. In 1921, the year he became the first comic actor to make $1 million a year, he was accused of raping and murdering an actress during an orgy at a San Francisco hotel. 
 It wasn't Hollywood that finally barred the door to Arbuckle -- friends like Buster Keaton helped him scrape together directing gigs under a pseudonym -- his audience left him. Back then, the Christian reform movement blamed movies for an epidemic of teenage degeneracy, but these proto-Don Wildmons loved Arbuckle, who radiated less sex than a lawn chair. 
 So when the comedian was exposed as a sweaty, waif-crushing love-manatee, it wasn't just a revolting crime -- it was a core betrayal of his conservative fans. A jury found him innocent, but it was too late. In this industry, Arbuckle's sin was worse than Mr. Gibson's: he wasn't bankable anymore. 
 That's what it comes down to. If you're going to offend your peers, parade unforgivable behavior and find all-new ways to turn your life into a nonstop shame-fest, you'd better also deliver big box office. 
 Speaking strictly as a paranoid Jew, I want my celebrity anti-Semites to be loaded mega-stars screaming into the night by the side of a road. How much more disturbing would it be to hear, say, Wilfred Brimley making the same racist claims over a bowl of groats, sober as a judge? 
 Mr. Gibson's anti-Semitism is in fact the least interesting thing about him. Maybe he was simply craving that next level of public humiliation; maybe his espousing of such heinous opinions and subsequent talk show tortures are valuable research for his violent onscreen debasements. 
 The point to remember is that every award won by ''Apocalypto,'' every ticket sold, doesn't mean that ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' will start inching upward on Amazon. Mr. Gibson's anti-Semitism may be as American as canned ham (that's the dark truth of why he's not been completely shunned), but his film will win accolades in spite of who he is -- not because of it. 
 What do I know? I'm in this business because somebody made a movie about my life as a drug-addled loser in Hollywood. If lifelong integrity were required for gainful employment in the entertainment industry, then I'd still be sweating through my McDonald's poly-blend, serving Happy Meals alongside other showbiz reprobates. 
 You simply can't vet the moral worth -- or at least, the absence of obvious, deep-seated depravity -- of every potential Oscar nominee. If they only gave work, let alone awards, to non-sickos, non-egomaniacs and non-hypocrites, there would be nobody left to make movies but Tom Hanks.

"487","Offer to Invest in Delphi Adds to Pressure on Union",1812997,"|business",19,12,2006,"20061219T000000","|Detroit (Mich)|United States"," 
 The United Automobile Workers union faces a difficult choice: reach agreement on concessions with the Delphi Corporation or risk seeing Delphi lose out on a deal that would help it emerge from bankruptcy. 
 A group of private equity firms led by Appaloosa Management and Cerberus Capital said on Monday that they were willing to invest at least $1.4 billion and up to $3.4 billion when Delphi emerges from Chapter 11. 
 But the offer hinges on Delphi's reaching a new labor agreement with its unions, led by the U.A.W., by Jan. 31. 
 Such an agreement has eluded Delphi since it filed for bankruptcy protection in October 2005, saying that its labor rates of about $27 an hour in the United States were too high to allow it to compete with nonunion companies who pay much less. 
 Union members at Delphi were paid essentially the same wages and benefits as their counterparts at General Motors, which owned Delphi until a spinoff in 1999. 
 But Delphi's chief executive, Robert S. Miller, has proposed terminating the union's contract and imposing wages as low as $12 an hour. The U.A.W. has fought the proposal; meanwhile, 12,400 workers agreed to buyouts and retirement incentives of up to $140,000 each this autumn. 
 On Monday, the U.A.W.'s president, Ron Gettelfinger, showed no signs that he was in any rush. 
 Matters affecting Delphi workers ''should be settled at the negotiating table by consent of the parties concerned, rather than by an order of the bankruptcy court,'' Mr. Gettelfinger said in a statement issued by the union. He added, ''Our membership will be heard.'' 
 For months, U.A.W. members have been airing their displeasure at Mr. Miller, setting up pickets outside his suburban Detroit home. But he will not be in his current job much longer. 
 Delphi said Monday it had named Rodney O'Neal as chief executive, effective Jan. 1, meaning that he will be overseeing talks with the U.A.W. Mr. O'Neal is Delphi's chief operating officer. 
 Mr. Miller will remain as executive chairman until Delphi emerges from bankruptcy protection and a new board is formed. 
 A United States bankruptcy court judge will consider the investment proposal on Jan. 5. 
 Five investors, Appaloosa Management, Cerberus Capital, Harbinger Capital, Merrill Lynch and UBS Securities, would invest an initial $1.2 billion and purchase $200 million in new Delphi shares, giving them a 30 percent stake in the auto parts company when it leaves bankruptcy. 
 They could spend up to $2 billion more if shareholders do not participate in a planned rights offering for 57 million shares. 
 A full $3.4 billion investment would give the investors 70 percent of the company. But a Delphi spokeswoman, Claudia Piccinin, said the company expected at least some of the offering to be bought by other shareholders. 
 Delphi also said it had reached agreements with J. P. Morgan Chase and other lenders to refinance its debtor-in-possession financing, which it has used to operate while under bankruptcy. 
 The agreement had been expected. Appaloosa Management, a $4.5 billion hedge fund led by David Tepper, is Delphi's biggest shareholder. 
 It has been one of the most active players in Delphi's bankruptcy case, heading an equity committee. There is also a creditors' committee established by the bankruptcy court in the case. 
 Another investor, Cerberus, led a group that recently purchased a 51 percent stake in the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the automaker's financing arm. 
 This month, the chief executive of G.M., Rick Wagoner, said he did not think a deal would be reached among his company, Delphi and the U.A.W. by the end of the month. Mr. Gettelfinger told workers last week that there had been little movement in the talks. 
 The U.A.W.'s contracts with Delphi and the Detroit auto companies expire next fall and some analysts have speculated that the union might try to avoid an agreement with Delphi until then. But the Jan. 31 deadline set by investors could make that strategy difficult to achieve."
"488","Jerry Berns, '21' Club's Pre-eminent Greeter, Is Dead at 99",1813641,"|obituaries|new york|region",22,12,2006,"20061222T000000",NA," 
 Jerry Berns, a proprietor of the ''21'' Club for a half-century and the last link to the restaurant's past as Manhattan's most celebrated speakeasy, died yesterday in Rancho Mirage, Calif. He was 99 and had homes in Rancho Mirage, Manhattan and Southampton, N.Y. 
 His daughter, Cecily Berns Rosenthal, his banquet manager for 14 years, noted that he died on Dec. 21. The cause, she said, was complications of surgery. 
 Under a ceiling hung with toy planes and trucks, Mr. Berns, his brother, Charlie, and their cousin, H. Peter Kriendler, created a center of Manhattan's social swirl at ''21.'' 
 For the better part of the 20th century, Mr. Berns and his two partners were the faces of ''21.'' He received the most powerful people in the nation as they arrived at the restaurant, housed in a brownstone at 21 West 52nd Street, walked past an honor guard of lawn jockeys and stepped inside. He was a host to every president of the United States from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Jimmy Carter, the chiefs of corporate America, potentates and panjandrums. He made a practice of kissing prominent women on both cheeks. 
 Some well-heeled regulars ate at ''21'' almost every day for 50 years, and the ever-present Mr. Berns helped make the club a tradition through generations. Couples celebrated the birth of a child by stocking wine to be opened when the newborn turned 21. The consummation of a business deal or a love affair was a cause for a table for two. 
 The best tables at ''21'' were in the original building; the outer-room Siberias opened when the restaurant expanded two doors down on 52nd Street. Mr. Berns knew who sat where, whether it was Ernest Hemingway, Frank Sinatra or Humphrey Bogart, who proposed to Lauren Bacall in the restaurant. 
 More than once, his daughter said, Mr. Berns averted disaster by making sure that the third party in a love triangle was seated out of sight. 
 Mr. Berns saw ''21'' evolve from a clandestine saloon to a grand salon. Before World War II, writers and actors and slumming millionaires drank elbow-to-elbow. Groucho Marx might rub shoulders with J. Paul Getty. After the war, the scene began to shift to brokers, bankers and the business elite. 
 The rooms smelled of cigars and money. The place practically invented the power lunch. It was very likely the first restaurant to charge $21 for a hamburger, a pinnacle it hit 21 years ago. It was perhaps the priciest place in the world to chow down on chicken hash. 
 The menu became fancier but the aura faded after the Berns and Kriendler families sold the restaurant to a business magnate in 1985 for $21 million. But ''21'' was never about the food. It was about the mood. 
 Herman Jerome Bernfeld was born on Feb. 19, 1907, one block north and five blocks west of ''21'' in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan. His parents had emigrated from what is now Poland. His father, Abraham, was a tinsmith who made the old-fashioned ceilings still found in Manhattan tenements. 
 His brother, Charlie, ran a string of speakeasies that were ''21'' precursors. His mother, Sophia, demanded that Jerry leave Columbia College to avoid the risks of running rum in New York. Sent to Ohio, Mr. Berns received an undergraduate degree in English from the University of Cincinnati in 1929. 
 His first wife, the former Martha Baeffsky, died in 1976 after 45 years of marriage. Their daughter Diane died in 1986. He married Suzanne Pogany in 1977; she died in 2000. In addition to Mrs. Rosenthal, he is survived by his wife, the former Dorothy Lyons, whom he married in 2005; six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Charlie Berns died in 1970; H. Peter Kriendler in 2001. 
 The club opened at its present address on New Year's Day 1930. In 1938, Jerry Berns, then the drama critic for The Cincinnati Enquirer, left the footlights of the Midwest for the grander stage on 52nd Street. For more than 12,000 nights thereafter, he was the first man the guests of the ''21'' Club met after they checked their hats and coats.

 Pakistan should do more to restrict the activities of Taliban leaders in and around the border area with Afghanistan in keeping with a United Nations resolution that considers its leaders to be terrorists, the deputy chief of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan said here on Monday. 
 The resolution, passed in 1999, listed 142 Taliban leaders as terrorists, but only a handful have been captured or their whereabouts established in the last six years, Chris Alexander, the former Canadian ambassador to Afghanistan and now the deputy director of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, said at a news conference. 
 The resolution, which has been renewed every year, calls for governments to prevent entry or transit of the individuals listed and for their assets to be frozen, and requires all states to prevent the direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer of weapons or military equipment to those individuals, he noted. 
 ''That Resolution 1267, as it relates to the Taliban leadership, is not so far being implemented,'' Mr. Alexander said. ''Pakistan has taken steps against some of the people on the list, and even arrested some of the people on the list, and most experts agree that others on the list are in Pakistan or at least were in Pakistan for at least part of 2006. 
 ''The truth is these networks are operating in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, that the leaders spend time in both countries, and that law enforcement and even military action is required wherever they are located.'' 
 At the same time, he said, Afghanistan and Pakistan must stop arguing and start cooperating to tackle the problem of terrorism together. Pakistan has cooperated on road building and health care in 2006, he said. 
 ''This war of words, this rhetorical contest between two governments, two partners, must end,'' Mr. Alexander said. ''Pointing fingers leads nowhere. What we really need, and what Afghans most need, is a constructive engagement and joint action to tackle a very serious security challenge.'' 
 Afghanistan has accused Pakistan of sheltering Taliban leaders and fighters who cross the border to attack in Afghanistan. Pakistan has responded by saying it would fence and mine the border. 
 Mr. Alexander said the United Nations was not pleased with that plan. ''This will not contribute to better security in either country in our view,'' he said. The United Nations and most countries in the world oppose the use of mines because of the danger they pose to the people who live in the mined areas, he added. 
 He said the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan had exacted its heaviest toll on Afghan civilians. There were 124 suicide bombings in Afghanistan in 2006, which killed or wounded ''hundreds of Afghans.'' Civilians also died in military operations by American and NATO forces. 
 He called for the Afghan government to show better leadership and said the Afghan people had made great achievements in 2006, including an economic growth rate of over 8 percent. ''Afghanistan cannot only weather the storm, Afghanistan can succeed,'' he said.

 IT was big news in the town of Smithtown in Suffolk County when, just before the New Year rolled in, 368 acres of land at a former state psychiatric institution in Kings Park were transformed into state parkland. 
 The property had been in dispute since the hospital closed in 1996, as a lawsuit sought to force the state to sell the land to a developer who planned to build as many as 1,800 homes there. 
 But the suit was dismissed in December by a New York State Supreme Court justice, and control of the land was transferred from the state Office of Mental Health to the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. 
 ''If you look at the land, it doesn't make sense to build housing,'' said Linda Henninger, president of the Kings Park Neighbors' Association, a local civic group that has opposed a housing development. 
 She said that the development would have broken up expanses of parkland surrounding it and that new residents in such an oddly placed subdivision would have clogged the hamlet's narrow roads. 
 The property, which has views of Long Island Sound, will now become part of Nissequogue River State Park, a forested 153-acre parcel next door that was also once part of the hospital -- although 90 acres of it could still be developed with park-related infrastructure like a pool. The transfer is ''great for the North Shore, and it's a beautiful park,'' Ms. Henninger said. 
 In the 1990s, as evolving treatment methods ended the practice of mass isolation of the mentally ill, Kings Park and other large state-run psychiatric hospitals on Long Island were shut down. 
 These institutions, including Pilgrim State and Edgewood State Hospital in Dix Hills and Deer Park and Central Islip Psychiatric Center, were small, self-contained cities. At their peak in the 1950s, tens of thousands of patients lived in residential buildings on the four sites, which had their own laundry and power plants, playing fields, swimming pools and other facilities. The hospitals employed hundreds of residents of local towns and hamlets. 
 The state shutdown left unemployment, large swaths of land and decaying buildings. 
 In Central Islip, the state transferred control of the land to the encompassing town of Islip. It hired developers to build attached town houses, which were sold at affordable prices. Parts of the hospital campus were also sold, for development of federal court buildings, a minor-league baseball stadium, shopping centers, offices and a technical college. 
 Those developments were made possible in large part by the existence of a local sewer system; the lack of such a system in Kings Park would make development more difficult and expensive. 
 Officials in Smithtown, who were working with State Senator John Flanagan on an effort to persuade the state to transfer the land to the town, were unprepared for the transfer of the land to the State Parks Department. 
 ''It took everybody by surprise,'' Frank DeRubeis, planning director of Smithtown, said of the state's move to make the land state parkland. 
 The town has been waiting 10 years for contaminated soil on the site to be cleaned up. It had also been studying a plan, financed by Suffolk County, to spur development in downtown Kings Park and downtown Smithtown by expanding local sewage capacity with an underground leeching field on the psychiatric center property, Mr. DeRubeis said. 
 ''Now it seems that whole thing is dead,'' he added. 
 The Kings Park Psychiatric Medical Center opened in 1885 as a rural branch of the Kings County Asylum in Brooklyn and was transferred to New York State 10 years later. In 1955, 9,300 patients were living there. 
 Three years after the hospital closed, 153 acres of the grounds were transferred to the Parks Department to create the Nissequogue River State Park, named for the river that runs through it. 
 The Office of Mental Health still operates two group homes and one residential care center for adults on 36 acres not transferred to the parks office. There are no plans to close these facilities. 
 From the community's point of view, it would seem there is little downside to the recent transfer. New York State pays taxes to the local schools under an arrangement that nets the district more than $5 million a year, according to Mr. Flanagan. About $2 million of that comes from the former psychiatric hospital property. 
 Since the state will continue owning the land, it will ''keep on paying those taxes on the land,'' he said. 
 That tax arrangement is unusual. It is dictated by Section 536 of New York's Real Property Tax Law, according to Jill Daniels, a spokeswoman for the New York State Office of Mental Health. The school districts in the same category as Kings Park are listed in the text of the law. 
 ''Parkland is our 'industrial,' '' said Ms. Henninger, the civic group president, alluding to the zoning category that in some towns brings in significant tax revenue. ''We get a lot of money for beautiful trees.'' 
 But before the hospital land is completely beautiful, the soil contaminated by the power plant and landfills on the site still has to be cleaned up. Last March, Mr. Flanagan said, the state budget appropriated $25 million to help with the project, which could cost $40 million to $60 million. 
 When the Empire State Development Corporation first requested proposals from developers, all of their plans called for high concentrations of housing to help cover the cleanup costs. 
 But that did not sit well with town officials. ''We felt all along that the developments were unacceptable because the state was selling to a developer, then walking away and leaving us with all that density,'' said Mr. DeRubeis, the planning director. 
 There remain 90 acres of the transferred land that hold abandoned psychiatric center buildings and could still be developed once the area is cleaned up. But Mr. Flanagan said such development would have to be ''consistent with the mission of a park.'' 
 For example, he said, one leftover building has an Olympic-size swimming pool and could become part of a community center if it were repaired and renovated. 
 Or, as at the historic Glen Iris Inn in Letchworth State Park in Castile, N.Y., or the lodge in Bear Mountain State Park, ''we could make a beautiful bed and breakfast,'' he said.

"492","At Rice, a Scorer's Patience Is Starting to Pay Off",1821760,"|sports",27,1,2007,"20070127T000000",NA," 
 When Morris Almond chose to attend Rice four years ago over such traditional basketball powers as Indiana, Notre Dame and Virginia, everyone seemed to have the same quip. 
 ''I heard more Rice-A-Roni jokes than you could imagine,'' Almond said. 
 But after a breakout junior season in which he set a Conference USA record for scoring and significantly bolstered his stock in workouts with N.B.A. teams before returning to Rice, Almond has those same impromptu comedians eating their words. 
 A likely first-round pick in the N.B.A. draft in June, Almond was the third-leading scorer in N.C.A.A. Division I entering Friday at 27.7 points a game, despite being the focal point of opposing defenses that often double- and triple-team him. He trailed only the Jackson State freshman guard Trey Jackson (29.9 ppg) and the Virginia Military Institute junior forward Reggie Williams (28.1 ppg). 
 Almond's play this season has been noticed by opponents and N.B.A. scouts, but it is often overlooked nationally and even locally. Rice, an academically prestigious institution, is an unlikely place to find one of the nation's leading basketball talents. Its most successful alumnus in the N.B.A. was the former Milwaukee Bucks star Ricky Pierce, whose career ended in 1998. 
 ''At a small school like Rice, you fly under the radar,'' Almond said. 
 A gliding scorer, the unassuming Almond is often compared to Allan Houston, the former Knicks guard, for his deft outside shooting touch and instant offense. 
 A 6-foot-6, 215-pound guard, Almond is shooting 47.7 percent from the field, including a 43.1 percent average on 3-pointers, and 87.4 percent at the free-throw line, where he averages just over 10 attempts a game. He is also averaging 6.9 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game for the Owls (10-8, 4-1). 
 ''He's got the total package,'' Texas-El Paso Coach Tony Barbee said after his team surrendered 29 points to Almond during a 73-67 loss Wednesday night. ''He's got the size, the athleticism, the skill and the basketball I.Q. Those guys are in the N.B.A., and that's where he's going to be one day.'' 
 Conference USA's preseason player of the year, Almond has scored 30 points or more five times this season, including a single-game league record of 44 points against Vanderbilt earlier this month. 
 But before Almond's breakout junior season, in which he averaged 21.9 points, he did not start a single game and averaged only 6 points a game. 
 After playing on the Georgia Stars, an A.A.U. team that featured eight N.C.A.A. Division I signees, and also playing with Atlanta Hawks forward Josh Smith at McEachern High School in Powder Springs, Ga., Almond expected to make an immediate impact at Rice. 
 But with three players who went on to score more than 1,000 points at Rice when Almond arrived in 2003, the Owls were saturated with scorers, leaving little playing time available. 
 ''He never wavered,'' Rice Coach Willis Wilson said. ''I give him all the credit in the world.'' 
 Still, there were glimpses of Almond's scoring prowess. During his freshman year, he scored 15 points in 14 minutes against San Jose State. As a sophomore, he had 18 points in 12 minutes against Louisiana Tech. 
 ''People used to laugh, but I'd tell people, 'Almond is the kind of kid that can lead the nation in scoring,' '' Wilson said. 
 After his junior year, Almond declared himself eligible for the N.B.A. draft. He played well enough in workouts with five N.B.A. teams to earn an invitation to the N.B.A.'s pre-draft camp in Orlando, Fla. 
 There, he excelled in front of general managers who had never seen him. But he was unable to get a team to commit to selecting him in the tier of players who receive guaranteed contracts, so he returned to Rice. 
 Almond is now projected as a mid-to-late first-round pick in this year's draft, which figures to be lean on guard prospects, said Chad Ford, an N.B.A. draft analyst for ESPN.com. 
 ''He's more N.B.A.-ready than some of the guys because he can shoot the ball, his age and his physical maturity,'' Ford said in a telephone interview. ''A guy like Almond could get minutes right away.'' 
 Ford added: ''The biggest thing that hurts him is that he's doing this for Rice. If he was on North Carolina or Duke or something, we'd probably be talking about this guy as a top-10 pick.'' 
 The success of Almond has also garnered the attention of Smith, who says he tries to watch his former teammate when Rice is on television. ''I always knew he was a scorer,'' Smith said in a telephone interview. 
 Since their days in high school, Smith, who skipped college and went directly to the N.B.A., said he has respected Almond for his determination. 
 ''He was always the guy that was in the library,'' Smith said. ''When everybody was out there kicking it outside, he was getting his studies. He's a real smart kid.'' 
 Almond, who has a 3.0 grade-point average, will graduate in May with a degree in sports management. Earlier this season, Almond learned how to cook from Wilson's wife, Vicki. Under her guidance, he and another teammate prepared a lasagna dinner and a fruit pizza dessert that received raves from his coach. 
 ''Morris has a lot of focus and discipline,'' Vicki Wilson said in a telephone interview. ''Whatever he decides to do, he can.''

"493","Libby Jury Leaves a Clue As It Heads Into Recess",1830091,"|u.s.",3,3,2007,"20070303T000000","|Iraq"," 
 The jury deliberating the perjury and obstruction of justice case against I. Lewis Libby Jr. recessed for the weekend on Friday without reaching a verdict, but not before leaving an intriguing clue as to the state of deliberations. 
 The jurors sent a note with a question to Judge Reggie B. Walton, who is expected to respond on Monday when deliberations resume. In the note, the jurors asked for further explanation of the concept of reasonable doubt, suggesting possible uncertainty or even disagreement over the core standard by which they are to measure the evidence and testimony about Mr. Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney. 
 ''We would like clarification of the term 'reasonable doubt,' '' the note said. ''Specifically, is it necessary for the government to present evidence that it is not humanly possible for someone not to recall an event in order to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt?'' 
 The question suggested that at least some of the jurors are wrestling with the imprecise and often vexing definition of reasonable doubt, as well as how to decide whether a false statement should be attributed to faulty memory or willful deception, the issue at the center of the case. 
 Prosecutors have contended that Mr. Libby lied to a grand jury and F.B.I. agents who were investigating the leak of the identity of a C.I.A. operative, Valerie Wilson, in the summer of 2003. As part of their case, prosecutors have contended that they have demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Libby lied when he said he did not discuss Ms. Wilson's role at the C.I.A. with two reporters. Moreover, the prosecutors have said that Mr. Libby also lied in an effort to cover up his role in the leak by testifying that he learned of Ms. Wilson's identity in a conversation with Tim Russert of NBC News on July 10 or 11. 
 Mr. Russert testified that in that conversation with Mr. Libby, they did not discuss Ms. Wilson. 
 Mr. Libby's lawyers asserted in their closing arguments that any misstatements Mr. Libby might have made were the result of a faulty memory. They also pressed the idea that memory is inherently imperfect, and that all the prosecution's witnesses demonstrated their own memory problems, which, by itself, was a demonstration of reasonable doubt. 
 The concept of reasonable doubt has proved troubling even for the Supreme Court, whose members have argued vigorously as to its definition and how it should be explained to a jury. There is, however, wide agreement that it is a more stringent standard than the ''preponderance of the evidence,'' the usual standard for a finding in noncriminal lawsuits. 
 The Supreme Court first made explicit the requirement in 1970 that, to convict someone of a crime, the jury must find that person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 
 But justices have, over the years, continued to disagree over whether various instructions given to juries by judges are acceptable. In 1992, the justices split in a ruling that upheld convictions in which judges had told juries that reasonable doubt was akin to moral certainty. 
 In his instructions to the Libby jury, Judge Walton said, ''A reasonable doubt, as the name implies, is a doubt based on reason.'' 
 He also said that ''if after careful, honest and impartial consideration of all the evidence, you cannot say that you are firmly convinced of the defendant's guilt, then you have a reasonable doubt.'' 
 He also noted, however, that ''the government is not required to prove guilt beyond all doubt or to a mathematical certainty or to a scientific certainty.''"
"494","2nd Ave. Subway Platforms May Get Glass Walls and Sliding Doors",1838203,"|new york|region",5,4,2007,"20070405T000000",NA," 
 The Second Avenue subway, as it is envisioned by planners at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, will have many modern features that set it apart, including roomier, brightly lighted stations with wider platforms that are cooled in the summertime and are fully accessible to the handicapped. 
 But as the authority prepares for a groundbreaking ceremony next week, planners are considering one innovation that would make the Second Avenue subway radically different from every other line in the city: mechanical doors on the edge of the platforms that would open to allow passengers to move on and off the trains. 
 The doors, set into a wall of glass or metal, would create a floor-to-ceiling barrier, sealing off the track and tunnel area from the platforms and altering forever the daily experience of waiting passengers. Gone would be the rush of air and thunder, gone the visceral thrill as many tons of steel hurtle by at high speed, just inches away, all replaced by the hygienic interface of technology. 
 Several subway systems in Europe and Asia use the doors, known as platform edge doors or platform screen doors. 
 They are also used in this country in many airport shuttle train systems, including the AirTrain at Kennedy International Airport. 
 Ernest Tollerson, the transportation authority's policy director, said Tuesday that the authority was studying the feasibility of incorporating the platform edge doors into designs for the Second Avenue subway. 
 The doors, he said, could allow substantial energy savings in the station cooling systems, which would use cold water to chill air blown into the stations and reduce temperatures by about 10 degrees. With open platforms, the hot air from the tunnels would mix with the cooled air in the stations. With doors on the platform edge, the heat from the tunnels would be at least partly blocked and the cooling system could operate more efficiently. 
 ''They have a lot of advantages in B.T.U. savings and things like that,'' Mr. Tollerson said. ''They improve the station environment. It's a design element worth looking at.'' 
 He described the initiative as part of a larger effort to consider the environmental impact of the authority's operations. 
 ''There is an interest in thinking about and figuring out -- if we're going to live in a carbon-constrained world and we're going to think about the ecological footprint of a global city and a global region -- where does the M.T.A. fit in all that and what should the M.T.A. be thinking about and doing,'' Mr. Tollerson said. 
 Engineers working on the new line's design had previously considered the platform doors, but the concept was rejected because of concerns about its cost and the way it would affect subway operations. It was opposed by Lawrence G. Reuter, who was president of New York City Transit from 1996 until February 2007. 
 Last month, however, planners at the authority asked the engineering firms that have been designing the subway line to take another look at incorporating platform doors. 
 Mr. Tollerson said the review was not related to Mr. Reuter's departure. He said the idea came out of discussions he had with Mysore L. Nagaraja, the authority's president of capital construction. 
 Mr. Nagaraja said that besides the potential energy savings, there were safety benefits as well. 
 With the door system in place, people could not fall or jump in front of trains. He also said the doors could reduce track fires, because people could not throw trash onto the tracks. 
 The doors would be likely to add to the cost of building the new subway line, which has a budget of $3.8 billion. Mr. Nagaraja said engineers would estimate those costs, and the degree to which they would be offset by savings in cooling expenses. 
 Mr. Nagaraja said that in earlier discussions of the platform edge doors, transit officials had expressed concerns about long-term maintenance requirements. 
 One concern is that most if not all train systems that use platform edge doors also incorporate a system of computerized train operation in which trains stop at exactly the same spot every time, and are always lined up properly with the platform doors. The authority has been working to develop a computerized system for New York subways, but it is still a long-term goal. With the current system, the doors would have to be designed to operate with trains controlled by human drivers. 
 The first phase of the new subway line is to include four stations, from 96th Street to 63rd Street, and is scheduled to be finished in 2013. 
 Mr. Reuter, the former transit agency president, said that in the 1980s and again in the 1990s, the possibility of retrofitting the entire subway system with platform edge doors was discussed at the authority. Both times, he said, the idea was discarded, largely because of difficulties in integrating the doors with the existing system. When the idea arose again in planning for the Second Avenue subway, Mr. Reuter said, he opposed it. 
 ''I definitely discouraged it because it's a cost item and it's a maintenance item,'' said Mr. Reuter, who now works in Miami as a senior vice president of Parsons Brinckerhoff, an engineering firm. ''It's only going to apply in a few stations. What good is it going to do if you can't adapt it to the rest of the system? I didn't see any benefit, plus it's going to cost extra money to maintain them.''"
"495","It's Time to Pack Up Those Beanie Babies",1838717,"|new york|region",8,4,2007,"20070408T000000",NA," 
 TWO of the dresser drawers in my 12-year-old daughter's room were broken. It was not the drawers' fault, nor Annie's. It was time. The top of the waist-high dresser had served as a changing table for our four children, and our oldest is now a college freshman. If that baby boy lay on that dresser today, his size 12 feet would scrape the floor. 
 So we threw out the dresser, which led to a reorganization of Annie's clothes, which somehow turned into a major revamping of Annie's room that took most of the weekend. As Annie noted about two hours in, ''This turned out to be an official room-cleaning project, didn't it, Dad?'' 
 Our timing was good. It was that cold, icy March weekend when we were happy to stay inside and wait for spring. 
 As it turned out, more change was afoot than just the seasons. 
 From under Annie's bed we pulled out several wicker bins where we'd been storing her American Girl dolls, a metric ton of American Girl clothes and an astonishing amount of other stuff. 
 ''Which dolls are these?'' I asked. 
 ''Duh, Dad, don't you know anything about American Girl?'' They were Felicity and Kit, which I used to know, when they were on top of the bed. All this, of course, was way too valuable to throw away, so it got put into plastic containers and stored in a crawl space under the house. 
 ''What's this?'' I asked. 
 ''Clothes that don't fit any more that Mom wants to keep because she likes the fabric.'' Under the house. 
 The deeper we dug, the more complex the decisions. 
 ''Is it O.K. if I throw away my horse collection?'' she asked. 
 ''Really?'' I said. 
 Horses had been her passion. She had amassed dozens of stuffed and model horses, subscribed to horse magazines, read horse books. While my wife and I are not horse people, her Grandma Libby was a competitive rider, and Annie took lessons during summer vacations in Michigan. 
 At 10, she'd been so excited about going to horseback riding camp. But after a week we received one of those pro forma chatty camp letters with a single worrisome line wedged in the middle: ''It's not what I thought!'' By the time we picked her up at the end of Week 2, she was done with horses. We never knew exactly why, though there were hints, like we'd sent her with the wrong kind of boots. 
 The verdict now was final. Much of the horse collection went into the trash, and her prized horse books (''Misty of Chincoteague,'' ''Stormy, Misty's Foal,'' ''Riding Days,'' ''I'll Take Cappy,'' ''Trickster'') were sent off to a bookcase in the back of the house. 
 We cleared off the top of the new bureau for makeup, nail polish, jewelry and body splashes. 
 We found many things that were definitely lost for good, including her iPod and ''Five Novels'' by Daniel Pinkwater, at 648 pages a hard book to lose. 
 We stored her blocks, though she asked to keep the five that spelled ''A-N-N-I-E.'' We found the dust cover to ''Chicka Chicka Boom Boom,'' a favorite, but could not find the actual book. We stopped to read several picture books and Annie decided not to send them away, because sometimes at night, when she is too tired to read a novel, she likes remembering her picture books. 
 She pulled out ''Puss in Boots,'' read some and said, ''Dad, this is just like 'Shrek 2.' '' 
 We had to reorganize the bookcases, because while everyone tells me, ''She doesn't look like you, she's pretty like her mom,'' she does get at least one genetic trait from Dad. ''I hate when books are slanted, absolutely hate it, '' she said. 
 As we packed up the Beanie Babies collection, she said, ''Remember how Uncle Harry said they're going to be worth a fortune someday?'' 
 We were paralyzed by some items. What to do with the dollhouse that her mom had worked so hard to build and paint and outfit? Annie hasn't played with it for years, but it was too big to go under the house. (The answer turned out to be nothing; it's still perched on her crafts armoire.) 
 We emptied the crafts armoire, sorting out the beads and wire and hemp she uses to make her jewelry. What had looked dazzling to a 10-year-old eye looked cheap to her 12-year-old eye, and we agreed to keep only the most beautiful plastic beads. We tested out her markers to see which were still good, and stuck them along with the colored pencils in several big coffee mugs. 
 We washed the linen liners of the baskets and, in place of the dolls under the bed, filled one with her favorite oversized T-shirts and the other with her sports uniforms (soccer, basketball, lacrosse, volleyball, softball). 
 I'd been so consumed with getting the room organized that it took a while to realize what was actually going on here: We were saying goodbye to the girl and bracing for the teenager. Gone is the Annie who would go up to her room, read for 20 minutes, then call down, ''Dad, guess what page I'm on now  higher, Dad  higher  way higher.'' 
 Arriving is the Annie who ordered a bomber jacket online from Hollister and said, ''The e-mail said 7 to 10 days. So by now, it's 5 to 8.'' 
 Toward the end, we found an old hand-drawn poster behind the armoire. When the kids were in elementary school, we used to get large poster boards from King's Pharmacy, and Annie and her brothers and I would lie on the floor drawing together, creating wild, elaborate jungle scenes full of William Steiglike creatures. Sometimes we would work on one drawing for weeks, then put several together to make a mural. 
 The two of us studied this one, remembering which beasts she'd drawn, which were mine and which were her brothers'. (''Remember this one, Dad? That's definitely Adam.'') 
 ''Where do we put it?'' I asked, thinking we might hang it up. 
 ''Throw it away, Dad,'' she said. 
 ''Really?'' 
 Twenty-five years before, when I was single and in my 20's, I'd gone back to my family home in Boston to help my mom clean the junk from her attic. My dad had died not long before; she was having a hard time and said I could get rid of whatever I thought should go. 
 What I remember most was how fast I worked, how decisive I was and my feeling of satisfaction at seeing three dozen bags of junk by the curb for the trash man. 
 This time, I wasn't so surefooted. Though I had permission, I couldn't throw away that jungle drawing, so I carried it down to my office and slid it behind a bookcase.

 Q. What is the most versatile piece of furniture I can buy? 
 A. Good question, the answer to which I realized while decorating my family's new apartment. 
 Over the years I have accumulated about a dozen of what used to be called ''accent'' or ''occasional'' tables. The former term I never quite understood, since ''accent'' seems to suggest an object that is decorative but of somewhat questionable use. ''Occasional,'' though, makes perfect sense: their use depends on the occasion. As far as I'm concerned, that is the definition of versatile. 
 In recent weeks, I've been struck by the plethora of tables of low stature and limited surface space, whether they are offered by a flea-market dealer or a high-ticket antiques shop on Lexington Avenue. The smallest are charmingly called ''telephone tables,'' which made sense back in the 1960s, when these diminutive items--the most popular were generally about a foot and a half high by a foot wide and mounted on brass casters--were de rigueur in the homes of stylish folks like Diana Vreeland, the legendary editor of Vogue. She and her high-society ilk were partial to snakeskin-clad telephone tables by Karl Springer, an American designer whose work can be found at Todd Merrill Antiques (65 Bleecker Street, 212-673-0531, merrillantiques.com) and Lobel Modern (39 Bond Street, 212-242-9075, lobelmodern.com). 
 Such small tables can still serve a multitude of purposes. I own three or four low, fretworked Chinese tables of various heights that I found at flea markets; the top of each is about the size of a standard box of tissues or a little serving tray. Their light weight makes them ideal for placing beside the bathtub to hold a glass of wine or a cup of coffee. They can also be placed in front of a crowded bedside table, as a perch for reading glasses and a book. 
 Pearl River (477 Broadway at Broome Street, 212-431-4770, pearlriver.com) has a stock of classic ceramic garden stools that make great occasional tables. Shaped like little beer barrels, they have come into fashion again, and the interior designers Michael S. Smith and Jeffrey Bilhuber have begun using them in large showers, as seating or for holding shampoos. The celadon green model ($225) is attractive. 
 Gump's, in San Francisco, has an openwork garden stool ($350), too, though it is more cube-like in shape and glazed in various shades of mossy green (800-882-8055 or gumps.com). Another good source for ceramic garden seats is Clipper Trading in Savannah (201 W. Broughton St., 800-390-0498, clippertrading.com). The company has several handmade models, including a chic solid black version with raised ornamentation that looks a bit like large nailheads ($179). Oriental Furniture (800-978-2100, orientalfurniture.com) sells a golden drum stool made of mahogany and elm, with a removable top for storage ($69). Remember that drums can perform splendidly as tables, too. The Duke and Duchess of Windsor, for instance, used old drums as side tables at their country house near Paris. 
 Spencer's Mercantile (905-525-6303 or mrsmcleans.com), a company in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, sells handcrafted replicas of historic drums. The Grenadier drum, a War of 1812 reproduction, stands 19 inches tall and 17 inches in diameter ($365), and the Regimental drum is just 16 inches high and 14 inches in diameter ($325). Pearl River also has splendidly spare wood stools with rectangular tops that would serve nicely as occasional tables, whether alone or gathered together in a line before a sofa. They are available in heights of 11 inches ($19.50), 18 inches ($29.50), and 24 inches ($39.50)."
"497","Criminal Charges Are Expected Against Marines, Official Says",1843249,"|world|washington",27,4,2007,"20070427T000000","|Afghanistan|Afghanistan"," 
 The Marine Corps is expecting criminal charges against at least five marines from a Special Operations unit that killed 10 civilians in eastern Afghanistan last month after a suicide bomb attack on their patrol convoy, a marine official said yesterday. 
 Marine and civilian lawyers involved in the case have been told to expect charges against five to seven marines involved in the shootings, possibly including one officer, said the marine official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
 The official added that a formal inquiry by naval investigators is continuing and could result in fewer or no marines being charged. The official declined to provide the names or ranks of those likely to be charged. 
 At least two marines have hired civilian lawyers, said a government official with knowledge of the developing case. 
 The Marine unit involved in the shootings arrived in Afghanistan in February, the first to be deployed from a new Special Operations Command formed by the Marine Corps last year to carry out specialized reconnaissance, intelligence and commando missions. 
 Several marines among about 30 who were on patrol began firing at civilians along a stretch of road near Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan, after a suicide bomber in a vehicle rammed their convoy and detonated his explosives, according to a preliminary investigation by the American military. 
 No marines were killed in the attack, but several marines, believing they were under small arms fire, began firing at bystanders near the scene and along the roadside as the convoy sped away, the military investigation found. 
 Over several miles, marines killed at least 10 civilians and wounded 33 others, including women and elderly men, according to the military investigation, which was ordered by Maj. Gen. Frank Kearney of the Army, the commander of all American Special Operations forces in the region. The investigation found no evidence that the marines were being fired upon. 
 A separate investigation by the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission said the marines had killed 12 civilians and injured 35 others. 
 The killings recall a similarly violent reaction by marines in Haditha, Iraq, in 2005, after a roadside bomb killed one of their comrades. In that incident, in the heart of a region rife with Sunni Arab insurgents, marines killed 24 unarmed Iraqis, including women and children in their beds, in a sweep of homes near the road. 
 After the killings in Afghanistan last month, General Kearney ordered the marines' whole company to leave the country and referred the matter to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. 
 The unit remains stationed somewhere in the Middle East but is expected to return to its base at Camp Lejeune, N.C., in coming weeks. A second Marine Special Operations company, at Camp Pendleton, Calif., is to deploy soon, said a marine spokesman, who would not say where the unit is headed. 
 Maj. Cliff Gilmore, a spokesman for the Marine Special Operations Command, known as Marsoc, said the group's commanders had not been advised about any impending charges against marines in the incident.

 THE NEW AMERICAN STORY 
 By Bill Bradley. 
 364 pp. Random House. $25.95. 
 Whatever happened to Bill Bradley? During his two decades in the Senate, this former Rhodes scholar and star forward for the New York Knicks accumulated an impressive record of accomplishment, particularly on economic issues. Intelligent, collegial and taller than Abe Lincoln, Bradley seemed just about the best the Democrats had to offer. But when he finally sought the presidential nomination, he displayed poor timing. The year, 2000, was inopportune -- his main rival was a sitting vice president with near identical views -- and Bradley lost. After Al Gore locked up the nomination, Bradley kept an indecorously long silence before endorsing him, and about a month before the general election he came out with a book, ''The Journey From Here,'' that was sprinkled with thinly veiled criticisms of his party's standard-bearer. Quite apart from the sour grapes, the book seemed strangely narcissistic. Mere weeks before Election Day, what need had voters for policy pronouncements from a candidate no longer in the race? 
 Now Bradley has written another book, ''The New American Story,'' outlining once again his plan for America. ''I'm outside the political pressure cooker now with no ax to grind and no political ambition to accomplish,'' he explains. ''What's here comes from my soul and from a new sense of freedom.'' But the old Bradley never seemed especially constricted when discussing government policy. He was admirably committed to principle and open to innovative ideas. The new Bradley, meanwhile, is hardly Zorba the Greek. He's a managing director at Allen & Company, a leading investment bank for the entertainment and technology industries. Bradley still writes like a politician -- much of the book has the windy quality of an overlong speech -- and I'm hard pressed to identify many policies he advocates here that he wouldn't have argued for (and in a lot of cases, did argue for) when he depended on voters' good will. Reading ''The New American Story,'' I often found myself wishing I were experiencing Bradley as a presidential candidate rather than as an author, and that's only partly a knock on the book. 
 Bradley's conceit is that the country's conservative leaders are telling ''a story about America that simply isn't true.'' He organizes the book's first half around these false narratives, which he recites at a level of extreme generality -- no quotations or attributions -- that allows him to maintain senatorial decorum while enjoying maximum freedom to create straw men (for example, ''What good is it, the story asks, to have the world's strongest military if you never use it?''). Bradley then answers each false narrative with a true narrative that expresses communitarianism, fiscal sobriety, respect for the environment and other social values typically neglected by the right. It's a tedious and somewhat gimmicky construct. 
 But books like this aren't really meant to be read. They're meant to be shaken, vigorously, to see what ideas fall to the ground. The best ones here tumble out of the section on the economy. To get the budget deficit under control, Bradley proposes gradually raising the minimum eligibility age for Social Security until the year 2099, when it would be 70 (he recommends a ''narrowly liberalized'' disability benefit for people in their late 60s whose jobs cause health problems that won't permit them to keep working). This is more than justified, he notes correctly, by the rise in average life expectancy (from 61 years to 78) in the seven decades since Social Security was introduced. Bradley has advocated this reform since his Senate days, but backed away from it during his presidential run when Gore used it to attack him. 
 Bradley also argues plausibly that it's time to close tax loopholes for the rich in exchange for a modest reduction in tax rates, as Congress did in 1986. This time he suggests capping tax subsidies for those who own a home, give to charity, buy health insurance and perform other activities the government wants to encourage, so that these subsidies don't benefit the wealthy disproportionately. The largely unregulated hedge-fund tycoons who've become this decade's avatars of highflying wealth should, Bradley urges, be restricted in their access to pension funds and required to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Before hedge funds took off, he writes, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board could calm the financial markets by phoning ''the key players.'' Today the Fed chairman lacks the means to know who many of those players even are. 
 Bradley has little to offer on the country's most vexing problem, the mess in Iraq. He calls the war ''the most serious foreign policy blunder I have seen in my lifetime'' and says we should end it. But his sole elaboration is ''Leaving has fewer long-term downsides than staying.'' This is the book's most glaring example of how the ''new sense of freedom'' Bradley enjoys in his post-political life, far from lending greater frankness to his pronouncements, enables greater avoidance. Were he running for president, he would be forced to detail when and how the troops should withdraw, what the likely consequences would be and how America should confront them. 
 On the other hand, Bradley the noncandidate is now willing to recognize as a ''potential approach'' to the health care crisis what he calls Medicare for All -- that is, socialized medicine. When he was a presidential candidate, he maintained the fiction that private insurance had a necessary role to play in a truly reformed health care system -- a fiction that continues to demand deference from today's major presidential candidates, mounting evidence to the contrary. Otherwise, candidate Bradley's health care plan was admirably ambitious -- and, he complains, grievously misunderstood. The plan's complexity made it ''prey to artful distortion,'' allowing the ''opposing campaign'' to exaggerate its potential costs and the risk that it would shortchange ''the most vulnerable citizens.'' Incredibly, Dollar Bill is still sulking about the fouls Gore committed seven years ago. He'd have forgotten them by now, if only he'd stayed in the game.

 DEAR DIARY: 
 Recently on the No. 1 train, I rode downtown from West 72nd Street in a car packed with tourists. Sitting near me was a group of college-age women, chirpy and seemingly normal in every way. 
 One of them, however, was holding a woman's shoe in one hand while the other hand dipped into the shoe to pull out pretzels, which she then munched. 
 Lots of people got off and on at the subsequent stops, while this pretzel woman kept dipping and eating. Finally, after she and her group departed at 34th Street, I just had to ask out loud, ''Did anyone notice that that woman was eating pretzels out of a shoe?'' 
 The people within earshot suddenly looked uncomfortable and averted their eyes. No one answered my question, and one man actually moved from our shared pole to the other end of the car. 
 But, really, I'd like to know, has anyone else ever seen someone eating pretzels out of a shoe?

 I'm a very senior citizen in a wheelchair, 
 Waiting at the curb to cross 72nd Street. 
 At my side is a stroller. 
 I'm eye to eye with a 6-month-old boy in a blue bunting, 
 Flirting with me. 
 I enjoyed the attention.

 A friend of mine lives in an apartment with a kitchen even smaller than most minimally functional New York cooking spaces. 
 He is so tired of trying to cook and get ice from the freezer and talk to guests that he has put up a sign intended to facilitate traffic flow. It reads: 
 ''Occupancy by more than one-half person(s) is unlawful.''

 I wasn't too surprised when a nearby Columbus Avenue restaurant closed up shop. The fliers that they distributed in the neighborhood when they first opened had, after all, boasted of ''Chicken to Die From!''

 About 9:30 on a Wednesday morning, I emerged from the subway station at Times Square to find about a dozen police cars in the street and a large group of officers massed on the corner, all wearing helmets and carrying rifles. 
 I stared as I walked by, and a young handsome policeman (about the age of my grandchildren) caught my eye, smiled and said, ''Good morning!'' 
 I returned the smile and the greeting and asked with some concern: ''What's going on here? Is anything special happening?'' 
 He replied, with another enchanting smile, ''We heard you were coming back.''

 My wife and I were walking through the cavernous Columbus Circle subway station and witnessed this scene, which requires no comment: 
 A disabled subway performer was playing his guitar and harmonica, guitar case open at his feet to accept donations. An elderly, stooped man walked by him, dragging a huge sack of empty soda cans. 
 The performer stopped playing, called out, ''Sir!,'' pulled two dollar bills from the guitar case and gave it to the old man, who said, ''Thanks,'' and walked on.

 While waiting to pick up my dog, Lulu, at NYC Veterinary Specialists, I overheard two young men talking to the receptionist. It was obvious by the look on her face that she wasn't quite sure who they were. 
 The mystery was solved when one of the men, in a loud voice, announced: 
 ''We're here to pick up Sherman, and yes, Sherman has two daddies.''

 I'm part of the army that marches every morning from Grand Central to the forest of office towers that now disguise Times Square. 
 One recent morning as I strode westward, I accelerated when I saw the ''Don't Walk'' light flashing. Having reached the corner of Avenue of the Americas just as it stopped flashing, I abruptly stopped at the curb. 
 Just then, a man about my age (mid-50s), with pedestrian tendencies obviously similar to mine, took two steps into the street, intending to race across. 
 As the northbound cars started to rev their engines in anticipation of the green light, he retreated to the curb. Our eyes met, and he sighed, ''Maybe 20 years ago''

 At a party at the Museum of the City of New York for the opening of the exhibition celebrating the 110th anniversary of The Jewish Daily Forward, I wandered downstairs to see the museum's two other shows, one on Robert Moses and the other on New Yorkers and the Spanish Civil War. 
 Overheard in the museum's shop: 
 A customer asking the cashier: ''Do you have the fascism T-shirt in extra-large?''

 The Austrian government said yesterday it had appointed Dominique Meyer, the director of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris, to lead the Vienna State Opera starting in the 2010-11 season. Joining him then as music director will be the Austrian Franz Welser-Möst, who holds the same position with the Cleveland Orchestra. Mr. Welser-Möst, who is also music director of the Zurich Opera, will succeed Seiji Ozawa. Mr. Meyer, 51, will replace Ioan Holender, the long-serving director of the house, who has said that he will not renew his contract. The succession became embroiled in politics when the Austrian chancellor and opera fan Alfred Gusenbauer was perceived as lobbying for his favorite, the American opera singer Neil Shicoff. The appointment was announced by Claudia Schmied, the culture minister, who oversees the opera house. Mr. Meyer has been at the Paris theater since 1999. He is a past director general of the Lausanne and Paris National operas and has held a number of government posts.
